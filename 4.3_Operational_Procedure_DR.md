# Backup_and_recovery

Preventive maintenance is more than just manipulating hardware; it also encompasses
running software utilities on a regular basis to keep the file system fit. 

These utilities can
include scheduled backups, check disks, defragmentation, and updates.

## Scheduled backups
Backups are duplicate copies of key information, ideally stored in a location other than the
one where the information is currently stored. 

Backups include both paper and computerrecords. Computer records are usually backed up using a backup program, backup systems,
and backup procedures.

The primary starting point for disaster recovery involves keeping current backup copies
of key data files, databases, applications, and paper records available for use. Your organization
must develop a solid set of procedures to manage this process and ensure that all key
information is protected. 

A security professional can do several things in conjunction with
systems administrators and business managers to protect this information. It's important to
think of this problem as an issue that is larger than a single department.

The information you back up must be immediately available for use when needed. If
a user loses a critical file, they won't want to wait several days while data files are sent
from a remote storage facility. Several types of storage mechanisms are available for
data storage.

## Working Copies
Working copy backups—sometimes referred to as shadow copies—are
partial or full backups that are kept on the premises for immediate recovery purposes.

Working copies are frequently the most recent backups that have been made. Typically,
working copies are intended for immediate use. These copies are often updated frequently.

## Journaling Many 
Journaling Many file systems used on servers include journaling. **Journaled file systems
(JFSs)** include a log file of all changes and transactions that have occurred within a set
period of time (such as the last few hours). If a crash occurs, the operating system can look
at the log files to see which transactions have been committed and which ones haven't. This
technology works well and allows unsaved data to be written after the recovery and the
system (usually) to be successfully restored to its condition before the crash.


## On-Site
Storage On-site storage usually refers to a location on the site of the computer
center that is used to store information locally. 

On-site storage containers are available that
allow computer cartridges, tapes, and other backup media to be stored in a reasonably protected
environment in the building.

On-site storage containers are designed and rated for fire, moisture, and pressure resistance.

These containers aren't fireproof in most situations, but they're fire-rated: A fireproof container
should be guaranteed to withstand damage regardless of the type of fire or temperatures,
whereas fire ratings specify that a container can protect the contents for a specific amount
of time in a given situation.

If you choose to depend entirely on on-site storage, make sure the containers you acquire
can withstand the worst-case environmental catastrophes that could happen at your location.

Make sure as well that those containers are in locations where you can easily find
them after the disaster and access them (near exterior walls, and so on).

## Off-Site
Storage Off-site storage refers to a location away from the computer center
where paper copies and backup media are kept. 

Off-site storage can involve something as
simple as keeping a copy of backup media at a remote office, or it can be as complicated
as a nuclear-hardened high-security storage facility. 

The storage facility should be bonded,
insured, and inspected on a regular basis to ensure that all storage procedures are being
followed.

Determining which storage mechanism to use should be based on the needs of the organization,
the availability of storage facilities, and the budget available. Most off-site storage
facilities charge based on the amount of space you require and the frequency of access you
need to the stored information.

## Image level
An image-level backup is also sometimes called a bare-metal backup. It is a backup in
which the entire system is saved, including operating system, applications, configuration
data, and files. 

It rapidly speeds up the recovery process because there is no need to reinstall
the operating system and the applications or to configure the server again before restoring
the data. It is called bare metal because this type of backup can be restored to a system
with no operating system.

## File level
Three methods exist to back up information on most systems.
Full Backup A full backup is a complete, comprehensive backup of all files on a disk or
server. The full backup is current only at the time it's performed. Once a full backup is
made, you have a complete archive of the system at that point in time. A system shouldn't
be in use while it undergoes a full backup, because some files may not get backed up. Once
the system goes back into operation, the backup is no longer current. A full backup can be
a time-consuming process on a large system.

## Incremental Backup 
An incremental backup is a partial backup that stores only the information
that has been changed since the last full or incremental backup. 

If a full backup
were performed on a Sunday night, an incremental backup done on Monday night would
contain only the information that changed since Sunday night. Such a backup is typically
considerably smaller than a full backup. 

This backup system requires that each incremental
backup be retained until a full backup can be performed. Incremental backups are usually
the fastest backups to perform on most systems, and each incremental tape is relatively
small.

## Differential Backup
A differential backup is similar in function to an incremental backup,
but it backs up any files that have been altered since the last full backup. 

If a full backup
was performed on Sunday night, a differential backup performed on Monday night would
capture the information that was changed on Monday. 

A differential backup completed on
Tuesday night would record the changes in any files from Monday and any changes in files
on Tuesday. 

As you can see, during the week each differential backup would become larger;
by Friday or Saturday night, it might be nearly as large as a full backup. This means the
backups in the earliest part of the weekly cycle will be very fast, and each successive one
will be slower.

When these backup methods are used in conjunction with each other, the risk of loss can
be greatly reduced. You should never combine an incremental backup with a differential
backup. One of the major factors in determining which combination of these three methods
to use is time—ideally, a full backup would be performed every day.

Several commercial
backup programs support these three backup methods. You must evaluate your organizational
needs when choosing which tools to use to accomplish backups.

Almost every stable operating system contains a utility for creating a copy of configuration
settings necessary to reach the present state after a disaster. 

As an administrator, you
must know how to do backups and be familiar with all the options available to you.

## Critical applications
You can back up critical applications and their data either by utilizing an image backup
(which would include operating system, applications, and application data) or by performing
a file-level backup and ensuring that you have included the application data. 

The
documentation that comes with the application should tell you the location of the data the
application stores. Taking this approach will require reinstalling the application on a new
machine to use the application data.

# Backup_testing

While many backup utilities offer a "verification process," nothing beats actually attempting
to restore the data. 

While test restorations may not be appropriate after every backup,
they should be done often to ensure that you have not been creating corrupt backups for
days on end.

# UPS

An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) is a solution to a number of power-related threats that can harm computers. 

Among them are the following:

- **Blackout** -This is a complete failure of the power supplied.
- **Brownout** -This is a drop in voltage lasting more than a few minutes.
- **Sag** - This is a short-term voltage drop.
- **Spike** - The opposite of a sag, this is a short (typically less than one second) increase in voltage that can do irreparable damage to equipment.
- **Surge** - This is a long spike (sometimes lasting many seconds). Though a surge is typically a less intense increase in power, it can also damage equipment.

The two solutions to know for the power issues on the exam are battery backups and surge suppressors.

## Battery backup
A battery backup, or UPS, keeps the system up and running when the normal power
is removed (because of blackout, brownout, and so on). Even in installations that use
generators to keep the systems running, battery backups are usually still used so they can
keep the machines running while the generators come up to speed.

Most UPS units come with software that can be used to configure the actions to take
when the battery backup is active. 

The software, for example, can be configured to shut down the connected devices when the battery begins to get low.

Always ensure that the UPS provides the required voltage for all devices.

# Surge_protector

A surge suppressor keeps a spike from passing through it and onto the equipment that
could be damaged. Tripping occurs when the breaker on a device such as a power supply,
surge protector, or UPS turns off the device because it received a spike. 

If the device is a
UPS, when the tripping happens, the components plugged in to the UPS should go to battery
instead of pulling power through the line. 

Under most circumstances, the breaker is
reset, and operations continue as normal. Figure shows a surge-protector power strip,
with the trip button to reset at the top.

Nuisance tripping is the phrase used if tripping occurs often and isn't a result of a serious
condition. If this continues, you should isolate the cause and correct it, even if it means
replacing the device that continues to trip.

Surge suppressors (also known as surge protectors), either stand-alone or built into the
UPS, can help reduce the number of nuisance trips. 

If your UPS doesn't have a surge protector,
you should add one to the outlet before the UPS to keep the UPS from being damaged
if it receives a strong surge. Figure  shows an example of a simple surge protector for a
home computer.

# Cloud_storage_vs._local_storage_backups

It is an option to store all backups in the cloud. 

The advantage is that you are protected against
any disaster that destroys your local backup tapes. 

The disadvantage is that when you need the
backups, if the cloud is your only option and you have no Internet access (a common occurrence
during a natural disaster), you will be unable to access those backups until Internet access is
restored. 

A more prudent approach may be a combination of both local and cloud storage.

# Account_recovery_options

In rare cases users lose access to their accounts. 

If these accounts reside in your directory
service such as Active Directory, you may be able to restore them using restoration procedures
that are beyond the scope of this book. You can fi nd more information here:
