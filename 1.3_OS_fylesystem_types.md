# File system types/formatting
New Technology File System (NTFS) is available with all the versions of Windows you need
to know for the exam, but all versions also recognize and support FAT16 and FAT32. The
fi le table for the NTFS is called the Master File Table (MFT).
This section lists the major fi le systems and the differences among them.

## ExFAT
**Extended File Allocation Table (exFAT)** is a Microsoft fi le system optimized for fl ash drives.
It is proprietary and has also been adopted by the SD Card Association as the default fi le
system for SDXC cards larger than 32 GB. The proprietary nature and licensing requirements
make this fi le system diffi cult to use in any open source or commercial software. This
fi le system is supported in Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10.

## FAT32
FAT, which stands for **File Allocation Table**, is an acronym for the fi le on a fi le system used to
keep track of where fi les are. It's also the name given to this type of fi le system, introduced in
1981. The largest FAT disk partition that could be created was approximately 2 GB. FAT32
was introduced along with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2. 

As disk sizes grew, so did
the need to be able to format a partition larger than 2 GB. FAT32 was based more on VFAT
than on FAT16. It allowed for 32-bit cluster addressing, which in turn provided for a maximum
partition size of 2 TB (2048 GB). 

It also included smaller cluster sizes to avoid wasted
space. FAT32 support is included in current Windows versions.

## NTFS
Introduced along with Windows NT (and available on Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows
8.1, and Windows 10), **NT File System (NTFS)** is a much more advanced file system in
almost every way than all versions of the FAT file system. It includes such features as individual
file security and compression, RAID support, and support for extremely large file
and partition sizes and disk transaction monitoring. It is the file system of choice for higherperformance
computing. Finally, it supports both file compression and file encryption.

## CDFS
While not a file system that can be used on a hard drive, **CD-ROM File System (CDFS)** is
the file system of choice for CD media and has been used with 32-bit Windows versions
since Windows 95. A CD mounted with the CDFS driver appears as a collection.

## NFS
**Network File System (NFS**) is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by
Sun Microsystems. While it is supported on some Windows systems, it is primarily used on
Unix-based systems; the SMB-based Common Internet File System (CIFS) is more common
on Windows systems for access to resources on other devices. To support NFS, Windows
systems make available the client for NFS. While the client for NFS is available in Windows
7, the Services for the Network File System (NFS) feature is available only in the Windows
8 Enterprise edition. This feature is not available in Windows 8 and Windows 8 Pro editions.
It is available in Windows 10.

## ext3, ext4
ext3 and ext4 are Linux file systems. While ext4 has the following advantages, it should
be noted that it is not compatible with Windows, while ext3 is. The following are the
strengths of ext4:
- It supports individual file sizes up to 16 TB (16 GB for ext3).
- The overall maximum ext4 file system size is 1 EB (exabyte); 1 EB = 1024 PB (petabyte), and 1 PB = 1024 TB (terabyte) (32 TB limit for ext3).
- The directory can contain 64,000 subdirectories as opposed to 32,000 in ext3.
- You can mount an existing ext3 fs as ext4 fs (without having to upgrade it).
- It improves the performance and reliability of the file system when compared to ext3.
- In ext4, you also have the option of turning off the journaling feature. A journaling file system is a file system that keeps track of changes not yet committed to the file system.

## HFS
**Hierarchical File System (HFS)** is a fi le system developed by Apple for use in computer
systems running MacOS. Designed for fl oppy and hard disks, it can also be found on readonly
media such as CD-ROMs. With the introduction of MacOS X 10.6, Apple dropped
support for formatting or writing HFS disks and images, which remain supported as readonly
volumes.

## REFS
**Resilient File System (ReFS)** was created for Windows 8 and was built on NTFS technology.
Its main contribution is the resilience to data corruption and maintenance of integrity.
Swap partition
The swap partition is used by the Linux kernel in order to implement the memory-swap
mechanism. Whenever there is a memory shortage, the system moves some information out
of memory temporarily to the swap portion of the hard drive. When the memory crunch is
over, the information is moved back to memory. Swap fi les in Linux are the equivalent of
page fi les in Windows.

## Quick format vs. full format
When you're installing any Windows OS, you will be asked fi rst to format the drive using
one of the disk technologies just discussed. Choose the disk technology based on what the
computer will be doing and which OS you are installing. For recent versions of Windows,
nearly all users should choose NTFS.

To format a partition, you can use the FORMAT command. FORMAT.EXE is available with
all versions of Windows. You can run FORMAT by using the command prompt or by rightclicking
a drive in Windows Explorer and selecting Format if Windows is already installed.

However, when you install Windows, it performs the process of partitioning and formatting
for you if a partitioned and formatted drive does not already exist. You can usually
choose between a quick format or a full format . With both formats, fi les are removed from
the partition; the difference is that a quick format does not then check for bad sectors (a
time-consuming process).

**Be extremely careful with the FORMAT command! When you format a drive, all data on the drive is erased.**
