# **Compare and contrast common operating system types and their purposes.**

## 32-bit vs. 64-bit
    - The primary difference between 32-bit and 64-bit computing is the amount of data the processor (CPU) is able to process effectively. To run a 64-bit version of the operating system, you must have a 64-bit processor. To find out whether you are running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows, you can look at the information shown in the System applet in the Control Panel in any of the Windows versions you need to know for this exam. 
    - Other differences between 64-bit and 32-bit systems are their hardware requirements and the types of applications you can run on them. You can run a 32-bit application on either a 64-bit or 32-bit operating system, but you can only run 64-bit applications on a 64-bit system. 

## RAM limitations
    - All operating systems have a minimum amount of RAM required to operate. It's not just a matter of functioning well; if you don't have that minimum memory, it won't install! 
    - Always consult the documentation to ensure that you meet this requirement. 
    - There is also a maximum amount of memory that an operating system can use, which is also useful to know. There is no use wasting memory in a device in which the operating system simply ignores it. The documentation that comes with the operating system will tell how much memory the system can support. 

## Software compatibility
    - Software is written to operate on a specific operating system or systems. For example, if it's written for Windows, it may not work on MacOS. If you intend to use an application, always check to see the operating system(s) it supports, which will be in the documentation. 
    - This may even influence the operating system you install. 

## Workstation operating systems
    - Workstations are the most common types of devices in our networks. These are the user machines, both laptop and desktops. There are three main operating systems used on workstations, Windows, Apple (MacOS), and Linux. 
### Microsoft Windows
    - While there are many Windows operating systems available, this exam asks that you know the intricacies of only four that run on the personal computer: Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10. Each will be covered in its own section in this chapter. 
### Apple Macintosh OS
    - In your career, you are almost certain to come in contact with the MacOS operating systems (since 2001 the MacOS system has been called OS X, so you may consider those terms interchangeable). Even though these systems constitute only a small percentage of the total number of devices found in enterprise environments, there are certain environments where they dominate and excel such as music and graphics. 
### Linux
    Linux is probably used more often than MacOS in enterprise networks, in part because many proprietary operating systems that reside on devices such as access points, switches, routers, and firewalls are Linux-based. Linux systems also predominate in the software development area. 
    - In this section of the chapter, you will be introduced to some of the common features and functions in these operating systems. 

## Cell phone/tablet operating systems
    - Computer operating systems are not the only type of operating system with which you will come into contact. Many tablets, smartphones, and other small devices will have operating systems that are designed to run on devices that have different resource capabilities and therefore require different systems. This section will look at operating systems for such mobile devices. 
## Microsoft Windows
    - The Windows operating system, which is the most widely used for desktops and laptops, may also be found on some mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, but it is not used as widely for these device types as iOS and Android. This is one of the best examples of closed source software. 
## Android
    - The Android operating system from Google is built on a Linux kernel with a core set of libraries that are written in Java. It is an open source operating system, which means that developers have full access to the same framework application programming interfaces (APIs) used by the core applications. 
## iOS
    - Apple iOS is a vendor-specific system made by Mac for mobile devices. Developers must use the software development kit (SDK) from Apple and register as Apple developers. 
## Chrome OS
    - Chrome is another operating system by Google that runs on its Chrome laptop. Based on the Linux kernel, it uses the Chrome browser as an interface. Originally it ran Chrome apps, but now Android apps have been made to run on it. 
## Vendor-specific limitations
    - Vendors of operating systems impose certain restrictions and limitations on the support provided to their systems. Two of the more important of these are covered in this section. 
## End-of-life
    - Whenever a vendor sets an end-of-life date, it means that after that date they will no longer offer help and support for that product. After that you are on your own regarding errors and troubleshooting. 
## Update limitations
    - When Microsoft and possibly other vendors release operating system updates, they sometimes make the update package available only to those who purchased a full copy of the previous version. For example, you can install Windows 10 as an update only if you have a full installation of Windows 8.1; going from Windows 7 to 10, you would pay for a full install. In cases like this, the update package will be cheaper than the full operating system, the idea being to give the customer credit for the purchase of the previous system. Those without the previous system must pay full price for a new installation of the updated operating system. 

## Compatibility concerns between operating systems
- While using a mix of desktop operating systems in an organization is not recommended, you may find yourself in that scenario. If that is the case, you may also find yourself supporting many more applications, as they are specific to the OS, and sometimes even to an OS version such as Windows 7 or Windows 10. Be aware that you may encounter compatibility issues between the systems and between the documents produced by the applications. Always research online about these issues, as someone has probably already solved the issue!
