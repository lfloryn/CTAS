# Compatibility tools

Several features are available to enhance the compatibility of the operating system with the applications you are running. First there is the Windows Compatibility Center, a site you can access that will scan your device for compatible device drivers, app updates, and downloads.

You just enter the name of the program, and it will tell you whether it is supported; if you need a driver or an update, it will provide it.

Running the application in a compatibility mode that supports it can make the application work. Simply right-click the program file and choose Run In Compatibility Mode and then select an operating system that supports the application.

In some cases, it may not be possible to use an application without creating a shim, which is a small piece of software that communicates between the unsupported application and the operating system. This is done with an Application Compatibility toolkit. There are such toolkits for Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10. Their use is beyond the scope of this book
