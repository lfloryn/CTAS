# diskpart

The diskpart command shows the partitions and lets you manage them on the computer's
hard drives. A universal tool for working with hard drives from the command line, it
allows you to convert between disk types, extend/shrink volumes, and format partitions
and volumes, as well as list them, create them, and so on. The diskpart command sets the
command prompt at the diskpart prompt as follows:

```dos
Diskpart>
```
