# [command name] /?

You can also get help information by typing /? after a command.

The /? switch is slightly faster and provides more information than the
HELP command. HELP provides information only for system commands
(it does not include network commands). For example, if you enter
help ipconfig at a command prompt, you get no useful information
(except to try /? ); however, typing ipconfig /? provides the help file
for the ipconfig command.
