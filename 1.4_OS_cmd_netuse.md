# net use
Network shares can be mapped to drives to appear as if the resources are local. The NET
USE command is used to establish network connections via a command prompt. For example,
to connect to a shared network drive and make it your M drive, you would use the
syntax 


```dos
net use m: \\server\share.
```

Figure shows an example of mapped drives.

This can also be done in File Explorer, as shown in Figure

NET USE can also be used to connect to a shared printer: net use lpt1: \\printername.


```dos
C:\> net use /?
The syntax of this command is:

NET USE
[devicename | *] [\\computername\sharename[\volume] [password | *]]
        [/USER:[domainname\]username]
        [/USER:[dotted domain name\]username]
        [/USER:[username@dotted domain name]
        [/SMARTCARD]
        [/SAVECRED]
        [/REQUIREINTEGRITY]
        [/REQUIREPRIVACY]
        [/WRITETHROUGH]
        [[/DELETE] | [/PERSISTENT:{YES | NO}]]

NET USE {devicename | *} [password | *] /HOME

NET USE [/PERSISTENT:{YES | NO}]

```
