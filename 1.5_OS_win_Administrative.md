## Administrative

Lists of the administrative tools, and the purpose for each, that you need to know
for this objective. The majority of these run in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

## **Windows administrative tools :**

# Computer Management

The Computer Management Console includes the following system tools:

**Device Manager, Event Viewer, Shared Folders,** and  **Performance/Performance Logs And Alerts** (based on the OS you are running, you may alsosee **Local Users** And **Groups or Task Scheduler**). 

Computer Management
also has the Storage area, which lets you manage removable media,
defragment your hard drives, and manage partitions through the Disk
Management utility. Finally, you can manage system services and applications
through Computer Management as well. 

It also has a Storage section,
which includes **Disk Management** and a Services and Applications section,
which includes Services and WMI Control.


# Device Manager 

Device Manager shows a list of all installed hardware and lets you add
items, remove items, update drivers, and more.

# Local Users And Groups

If Local Users And Groups is not visible in the left pane of MMC, choose
File Add/Remove Snap-in and select Local Users And Groups from the
list of possible snap-ins. You can choose to manage the local computer
or another computer (requiring you to provide its address). The built-in
groups for a domain are a superset of local groups. Local Users And
Groups is not available for Windows 7 editions lower than Professional.

In all other editions, you must manage user accounts using the User
Accounts applet in the Control Panel, and you cannot create or manage
groups. The default users created are Administrator, Guest, and the
administrative account created during the install

# Local Security Policy

The Local Security Policy (choose Start and then enter secpol.msc)
allows you to set the default security settings for the system. This feature
is available only in Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate,
Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8 Ultimate, Windows
8 Professional (old Business), and Windows 8 Enterprise editions.

# Performance Monitor

Performance Monitor differs a bit between Windows versions but has
the same purpose throughout: to display performance counters. Two
tools are available—System Monitor and Performance Logs And Alerts.

System Monitor will show the performance counters in graphical format.

The Performance Logs And Alerts utility collects the counter information
and then sends it to a console (such as the one in front of the
admin so they can be aware of the problem) or event log.

# Services 

The Services tab is illustrated and discussed later in this section.

# System Configuration

MSConfig, known as the System Configuration utility, helps you troubleshoot
startup problems by allowing you to selectively disable individual
items that normally are executed at startup. It works in all versions of Windows,
although the interface window is slightly different among versions.

# Task Scheduler 

Task Scheduler allows you to configure jobs to automatically run unattended.
For the run frequency, you can choose any of the following
options: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, One Time Only, When The Computer
Starts, or When You Log On. 

You can access a job's advanced properties
any time after the job has been created. To do so, double-click the icon
for the job in the Scheduled Tasks screen. In the resulting dialog box,
you can configure such things as the username and password associated
with the job, the actual command line used to start the job (in case
you need to add parameters to it), and the working directory.

 At any
time, you can delete a scheduled job by deleting its icon, or you can simply
disable a job by removing the check mark from the Enabled box on
the Task tab of the task's properties dialog box. For jobs that are scheduled
to run, a picture of a clock appears in the bottom-left corner of the
icon; jobs not scheduled to run do not have that clock.

# Component Services

Component Services is an MMC snap-in that allows you to administer,
as well as deploy, component services and to configure behavior such as
security (Component Services is located beneath Administrative Tools).

# Data Sources 
ODBC Data Source Administrator (located beneath Administrative Tools)
allows you to interact with database management systems.

# Print Management

Available in Windows 7 and Windows Vista, Print Management (located
beneath Administrative Tools) allows you to manage multiple printers and
print servers from a single interface. Print Management is not available
for Windows 7 in any edition lower than Windows 7 Professional. 

In all
later editions of Windows (Vista, 8, 8.1, 10), you must manage individual
printers using the Printers applet in the Control Panel.

# Windows Memory Diagnostics

The Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool (located beneath Administrative
Tools) can be used to check a system for memory problems. For the tool
to work, the system must be restarted. 

The two options that it offers
are to restart the computer now and check for problems or wait and
check for problems on the next restart. Upon reboot, the test will take
several minutes, and the display screen will show which pass number is
being run and the overall status of the test (percentage complete). 

When
the memory test concludes, the system will restart again, and nothing
related to it is apparent until you log in. If the test is without error, you'll
see a message that no errors were found. If anything else is found, the
results will be displayed.

# Windows Firewall
Windows Firewall **(Start ➢ Control Panel ➢ Windows Firewall)** is used
to block access from the network, and in Windows 7, it is divided into
separate settings for private networks and public networks. While
host-based firewalls are not as secure as other types of firewalls, this
provides much better protection than previously and is turned on by
default. It is also included in the Security component of the Action Center
and can be tweaked significantly using the Advanced Settings.

# Advanced Security

Continuing the discussion of Windows Firewall, once you click Advanced
Settings, Windows Firewall with Advanced Security opens. Here, you can
configure inbound and outbound rules as well as import and export policies
and monitor. Monitoring is not confined only to the firewall; you can
also monitor security associations and connection security rules. Not only
can this MMC snap-in do simple configuration, but it can also configure
remote computers and work with Group Policy.

# User Account Management
Used to create, delete, and configure properties of user accounts in
Windows 10.


# Event Viewer
Windows employs comprehensive error and informational logging routines. Every program
and process theoretically could have its own logging utility, but Microsoft has come up
with a rather slick utility, Event Viewer, which, through log files, tracks all events on a particular
Windows computer. Normally, though, you must be an administrator or a member
of the Administrators group to have access to Event Viewer.

The process for starting Event Viewer differs based on the operating system you are running,
but always log in as an administrator (or equivalent). With Windows 7, using Small or
Large icons view, choose Start Control Panel Administrative Tools Event Viewer; on earlier
systems, choose Start Programs Administrative Tools Event Viewer (or you can always
right-click the Computer desktop icon and choose Manage Event Viewer). In the resulting
window , you can view the System, Application, and Security log
files. If you are running Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, or Windows 10, you will
also see log files available for Setup and Forwarded Events.

- The System log file displays alerts that pertain to the general operation of Windows.
- The Application log file logs application errors.
- The Security log file logs security events such as login successes and failures.
- The Setup log will appear on domain controllers and will contain events specific
to them.
- The Forwarded Events log contains events that have been forwarded to this log by
other computers.

## The opening interface of Event Viewer

These log files can give a general indication of a Windows computer's health.

To access Event Viewer in Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, just enter event viewer in the
desktop Search box, and when the option for opening Event Viewer appears, select it.

One situation that does occur with Event Viewer is that the log files get full. Although
this isn't really a problem, it can make viewing log files confusing because there are so
many entries. Even though each event is time- and date-stamped, you should clear Event
Viewer every so often. To do this, open Event Viewer, and in Windows 7, right-click the
log, choose Properties, and click the Clear Log button; in earlier OS versions, choose Clear
All Events from the Log menu. 

Doing so erases all events in the current log file, allowing
you to see new events more easily when they occur. You can set maximum log size by rightclicking
the log and choosing Properties. By default, when a log fills to its maximum size,
old entries are deleted in first in, first out (FIFO) order. Clearing the log, setting maximum
log size, and setting how the log is handled when full are done in the Log Properties dialog
box, as shown.

## The Log Properties dialog box

![event](/img/f1.5_eventviewer_log.jpg)


![note](/img/note.jpg)   You can save the log files before erasing them. The saved files can be
burned to a CD or DVD for future reference. Often, you are required to
save the files to CD or DVD if you are working in a company that adheres to
strict regulatory standards.

In addition to just erasing logs, you can confi gure three different settings for what you want
to occur when the fi le does reach its maximum size. 

The first option is Overwrite Events As
Needed (Oldest Events First), which replaces the older events with the new entries.

The second
option is Archive The Log When Full, Do Not Overwrite Events, which will create another log
file as soon as the current one runs out of space. 

The third option, Do Not Overwrite Events
(Clear Logs Manually), will not record any additional events once the file is full.

A scenario for using Event Viewer would be in the case of an attempted improper login.
You could use the log to identity the time, machine, and other information concerning the
attempt.
