# Active_Directory

Active Directory (AD) is the directory service used in Windows since Windows 2000. It is
used to locate resources and is also the point of configuration for all things security in a
Windows domain (a concept to be explained shortly). 

It has a hierarchical structure that
can be leveraged when using one of the more powerful tools of AD, Group Policy. Let's survey
some of the concepts of AD.

## Login script
While not required, login scripts run as soon as a user completes successful authentication.
These scripts can automate a wide variety of operations, like mapping drives for users and
checking for updates.

## Domain
When a new AD structure is created, a new forest containing one domain is created. By
default, all objects residing in a domain share the same security policies. Domains can be
subdivided into organizational units (OUs), which can be used as targets for additional
policies that you would like to confine to the OU.


![Sec](/img/f2.1_Sec_AD.jpg)



## Group policy/updates
When group policies are created, they can be applied to both computers and users and can
be applied at either the domain or the OU level in the hierarchy.

When policies are added or updated, these changes are refreshed at certain intervals on
the computers. Outside of these intervals, devices also check when rebooting and starting
up. Finally, administrators can force an update at any time using the gpudate command.

## Organizational units
As noted, domains can be subdivided into OUs, and OUs can also have child OUs. You can
build whatever structure suits the efficient application of policies. While policy inheritance
can be prevented, doing so complicates things, and a well thought-out structure will result
in allowing inheritance to operate.

## Home folder
Home folders make it easier for an administrator to back up user files and manage user
accounts by collecting the user's files in one location. If you assign a home folder to a user,
you can store the user's data in a central location on a server and make backup and recovery
of data easier and more reliable. If no home folder is assigned, the computer assigns the
default local home folder to the user account. The home folder can use the same location as
the My Documents folder.

## Folder redirection
Along with creating a Home folder, folder redirection is an alternative method of automatically
rerouting I/O to/from standard folders (directories) to use storage elsewhere on a
network.

# Software_tokens

Software tokens are stored in software and can be duplicated. They are typically used in
multifactor authentication mechanisms. Their purpose and use is the same as a hardware
or physical token (described earlier in this chapter). Software tokens are cheaper than hardware
tokens and do not have a battery that can run down as hardware tokens do.

# MDM_policies

Mobile Device Management (MDM) policies can be created in AD, or they can be implemented
through MDM software. This software allows you to exert control over the mobile
devices, even those you do not own if they have the software installed. These policies can
force data encryption and data segregation, and they can be used to wipe a stolen device
remotely.

[Top](#Index) 

# Port_security

One of the basic principles of security is to reduce the attack surface of all devices. This
means shutting off all services and applications that are not required and closing all ports
not being used. 

With respect to switches and hubs, it means disabling any ports that do not
have devices connected to them. If this is not done, anyone could walk up to any unused
wall outlet, plug in a device, get an IP address through DHCP, and be on your network.

But sometimes you want to prevent someone from unplugging a legitimate device and
plugging in one that is not legitimate. That's where port security comes in. By confi guring
port security on the port, you can prevent the transmission of data by any device other than
the legitimate one. You can even shut the port down if this occurs.

Port security can also refer to the limitation of access that allows only well-known TCP and
UDP port numbers. Limiting access to allow only required ports reduces the attack surface.

**MAC address filtering**

Most APs and network switches offer the ability to turn on MAC filtering , but it is off
by default. In the default state, any wireless client that knows the values looked for can
join the network, and any device connected to a switch port can send traffic.

 When MAC
filtering is used, the administrator compiles a list of the MAC addresses associated with
the users' computers and enters those. When a client attempts to connect and other values
have been correctly entered, an additional check of the MAC address is done. If the address
appears in the allowed list, the client is allowed to join; otherwise, they are forbidden from
doing so. On a number of wireless devices, the term network lock is used in place of MAC
filtering, and the two are synonymous.

**MAC address filtering at the wireless level is useless** because it is quite simple to identify
an allowed MAC address by sniffing the wireless frames. Then a hacker can simply change
his MAC address to an allowed one.

Adding **port authentication**to MAC filtering takes security for the network
down to the switch port level and increases your security exponentially.

# Certificates
A certifi cate is a text document that ties a user account to a public and private key pair created
by a certifi cate server or certifi cate authority (CA). Certifi cates follow the X.509 standard,
which requires them to include certain pieces of information.

- Certificate
- Version number
- Serial number
- Signature algorithm ID
- Issuer name
- Validity period
- Not before
- Not after
- Subject name
- Subject public key info
- Public key algorithm
- Subject public ley
- Issuer unique identifier (optional)
- Subject unique identifier (optional)
- Extensions (optional)
- Certificate signature algorithm
- Certificate Signature

# Antivirus/Anti-malware

The primary method of preventing the propagation of malicious code involves the use of
antivirus software , a type of application that is installed on a system to protect it and to
scan for viruses as well as worms and Trojan horses. Most viruses have characteristics that
are common to families of a virus or viruses. Antivirus software looks for these characteristics,
or fi ngerprints, to identify and neutralize viruses before they impact you.

More than 200,000 known viruses, worms, bombs, and other malware have been
defi ned. New ones are added all the time. Your antivirus software manufacturer will usually
work hard to keep the defi nition database fi les current. The defi nition database fi le
contains all the known viruses and countermeasures for a particular antivirus software
product. You probably won't receive a virus that hasn't been seen by one of these companies.

If you keep the virus defi nition database fi les in your software up-to-date, you probably
won't be overly vulnerable to attacks.

The best method of protection is to use a layered approach. Antivirus software
should be at the gateways, at the servers, and at the desktop.

 If you
want to go one step further, you can use software at each location from
different vendors to make sure you're covered from all angles.

# Firewalls

Firewalls are one of the fi rst lines of defense in a network. There are different types of
fi rewalls, and they can be either stand-alone systems or included in other devices such as
routers or servers. You can fi nd fi rewall solutions that are marketed as hardware only and
others that are software only. Many fi rewalls, however, consist of add-in software that is
available for servers or workstations.

Although solutions are sold as "hardware only," the hardware still runs
some sort of software. It may be hardened and in ROM to prevent tampering,
and it may be customizedâ€”but software is present nonetheless.

The basic purpose of a fi rewall is to isolate one network from another. Firewalls are
becoming available as appliances, meaning they're installed as the primary device separating
two networks. Appliances are freestanding devices that operate in a largely self-contained
manner, requiring less maintenance and support than a server-based product.

Firewalls function as one or more of the following:

- Packet filter
- Proxy firewall
- Stateful inspection firewall

To understand the concept of a firewall, it helps to know where the term
comes from. In days of old, dwellings used to be built so close together
that if a fire broke out in one, it could easily destroy a block or more before
it could be contained. 

To decrease the risk of this happening, firewalls were
built between buildings. The firewalls were huge brick walls that separated
the buildings and kept a fire confined to one side. The same concept of
restricting and confining is true in network firewalls. Traffic from the outside
world hits the firewall and isn't allowed to enter the network unless
otherwise invited.


The firewall shown in Figure effectively limits access from outside networks, while
allowing inside network users to access outside resources. The firewall in this illustration is
also performing proxy functions.

![Sec](/img/f2.1_Sec_fw1.jpg)

External network Proxy Internal network

![note](/img/note.jpg) Although firewalls are often associated with outside traffic, you can place
a firewall anywhere. For example, if you want to isolate one portion of your
internal network from others, you can place a firewall between them.

The following list discusses three of the most common functions that firewalls
perform:

**Packet Filter Firewalls** A firewall operating as a packet filter passes or blocks traffic to
specific addresses based on the type of application. The packet filter doesn't analyze the
data of a packet; it decides whether to pass it based on the packet's addressing information.

For instance, a packet filter may allow web traffic on port 80 and block Telnet traffic on
port 23. This type of filtering is included in many routers. If a received packet request asks
for a port that isn't authorized, the filter may reject the request or simply ignore it. Many
packet filters can also specify which IP addresses can request which ports and allow or
deny them based on the security settings of the firewall.

Packet filters are growing in sophistication and capability. A packet filter firewall can allow
any traffic that you specify as acceptable. For example, if you want web users to access
your site, then you configure the packet filter firewall to allow data on port 80 to enter. If
every network were exactly the same, firewalls would come with default port settings hardcoded,
but networks vary, so the firewalls don't include such settings.

**Proxy Firewalls** A proxy firewall can be thought of as an intermediary between your
network and any other network. Proxy firewalls are used to process requests from an
outside network; the proxy firewall examines the data and makes rule-based decisions
about whether the request should be forwarded or refused. The proxy intercepts all the
packages and reprocesses them for use internally. This process includes hiding internal
IP addresses.

The proxy firewall provides better security than packet filtering because of the increased
intelligence that a proxy firewall offers. Requests from internal network users are routed
through the proxy. The proxy, in turn, repackages the request and sends it along, thereby
isolating the user from the external network. The proxy can also offer caching, should the
same request be made again, and can increase the efficiency of data delivery.

A proxy firewall typically uses two network interface cards (NICs). This type of firewall is
referred to as a dual-homed firewall. One of the cards is connected to the outside network,
and the other is connected to the internal network. The proxy software manages the connection
between the two NICs. This setup segregates the two networks from each other
and offers increased security. 

The proxy function can occur at either the application level or the circuit level.
Application-level proxy functions read the individual commands of the protocols that are
being served. This type of server is advanced and must know the rules and capabilities
of the protocol used.

An implementation of this type of proxy must know the difference
between GET and PUT operations, for example, and have rules specifying how to execute
them. A circuit-level proxy creates a circuit between the client and the server and doesn't
deal with the contents of the packets that are being processed.

![Sec](/img/f2.1_Sec_fw2.jpg)


A unique application-level proxy server must exist for each protocol supported. Many
proxy servers also provide full auditing, accounting, and other usage information that
wouldn't normally be kept by a circuit-level proxy server.


**Stateful Inspection Firewalls** The last section on firewalls focuses on the concept of stateful
inspection. Stateful inspection is also referred to as stateful packet filtering. Most of
the devices used in networks don't keep track of how information is routed or used. After a
packet is passed, the packet and path are forgotten. In stateful inspection (or stateful packet
filtering), records are kept using a state table that tracks every communications channel.


Stateful inspections occur at all levels of the network and provide additional security, especially
in connectionless protocols such as User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and Internet
Control Message Protocol (ICMP). This adds complexity to the process. Denial-of-service
(DoS) attacks present a challenge because flooding techniques are used to overload the state
table and effectively cause the firewall to shut down or reboot.

# User_authentication/strong_passwords

You can set up many different parameters and standards to force the people in your organization
to conform with security practices. In establishing these parameters, it's important
that you consider the capabilities of the people who will be working with these policies. 

If
you're working in an environment where people aren't computer savvy, you may spend a lot
of time helping them remember and recover passwords. Many organizations have had to
reevaluate their security guidelines after they've invested great time and expense to implement
high-security systems.

Setting authentication security, especially in supporting users, can become a highmaintenance
activity for network administrators. On one hand, you want people to be able
to authenticate themselves easily; on the other hand, you want to establish security that
protects your company's resources.

In a Windows server domain, password policies can
be confi gured at the domain level using Group Policy objects. Variables you can confi gure
include password complexity, length, and time between allowed changes.

A good password includes both uppercase and lowercase letters as well as numbers and
symbols. In the past an accepted practice was to make passwords complex (using at least
three of the four character types: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and non-numeric fi gures),
but recently the NIST has recommended that longer and simpler passwords are more secure
than shorter and more complex ones.

Be wary of popular names or current trends that make certain passwords predictable.
For example, during the fi rst release of Star Wars , two of the most popular passwords used
on college campuses were C3PO and R2D2. This created a security problem for campus
computer centers. Educate users not to use personal information that one could easily guess
about them, such as their pet names, anniversary, or birthdays.


##  Security and Permission Tips for Users
    
Once you've made the choice of operating system and infrastructure, there is not much your users can do to improve or change the security of the directory services deployed.
However, you can educate them to ensure that they don't become tools for an attacker bent on compromising your organization's security. Pass along the following dos and don'ts:
    
    -  Ensure that your client software is using the most secure form of authentication encryption supported by both the client and the authentication servers.
    -  Use encrypted software and protocols whenever possible, even for internal communications.
    -  Change your password according to the company's password policy.
    -  Use a company-established minimum character password that is unique for each account. While many companies set the minimum at 8 characters, it is not uncommon to see this set at 16.
    -  Never write your password down, or if you do, divide it up into several pieces and store each in a different secure location (such as a home safe, a gun cabinet, a chemical supply locker, or a safety deposit box).
    -  Never share your password or your logon session with another person; this includes your friends, spouse, and children.
    -  Verify that your client always interacts with an authentication server during the network logon process and does not use cached credentials.
    -  Allow all approved updates and patches to be installed onto your client.
    -  Ensure that all company data is copied back to a central file server before disconnecting from a logon session.
    -  Back up any personal data onto verified removable media.
    -  Never walk away from a logged-on workstation.
    -  Employ a password-protected screensaver.
    -  Don't use auto-logon features.
    -  Be aware of who is around you (and may be watching you) when you log on and when you work with valuable data.
    -  Never leave a company laptop, mobile phone, or PDA in a position where it can be stolen or compromised while you are away from the office. Cable locks should be used to keep notebooks securely in place whenever you are off-site.

# Multifactor_authentication

There are three factors of authentication: knowledge factors (something you know, such as
a password), characteristic factors (some physical characteristic, such as a thumbprint), and
behavioral factors (something you do, such as a voice analysis).

When more than one of these factors is required to authenticate, it is called multifactor
authentication . It is not multifactor authentication if it uses two forms of the same factor of
authentication such as a password and a PIN (both knowledge factors). An example of multifactor
authentication is the requirement of a PIN and a retina scan.

# Directory_permissions

The protection of a directory service is based on the initial selection of network operating
system and its deployment infrastructure. 

After these foundational decisions are made,
you need to fully understand the technologies employed by your selected directory services
system and learn how to make the most functional yet secure environment possible. This
will usually require the addition of third-party security devices, applications, services, and
solutions.

As for the permission on directories themselves, that is governed by **NTFS**,
which was discussed in, "Operating Systems."

# VPN

**Virtual private network (VPN)** connections are remote access connections that allow users
to securely connect to the enterprise network and work as if they were in the office. 

These
connections use special tunneling protocols that encrypt the information being transferred
between the user and the corporate network. Anywhere users, business partners, or vendors
are allowed remote access to the network, VPN connections should be used. VPNs were
discussed.

# DLP
**Data loss prevention (DLP)** solutions are designed to prevent sensitive material from
purposefully or inadvertently escaping the organization. These solutions allow you to
specify exactly what actions each user may take with respect to a document. For example,
you may choose to allow the document to be read but neither printed nor forwarded to
another user.

[Top](#Index)

# Access_control_lists

Access control lists (ACLs) are sets of rules that either control access to a resource or are
configured on a router or firewall to control the type of traffic allowed to enter or leave an
interface. 

These lists are what make packet filtering firewalls work. Using these lists, an
administrator can at a granular level define who can send specific types of traffic to specific
locations. 

For example, you could prevent a user from using Telnet to connect to the sales
server, without preventing him from using Telnet to connect to any other devices and without
impacting any of his other activities.

# Smart_card
Smart cards were discussed in detail in the section "Smart cards" later in this chapter.
While the emphasis there was on using smart cards for physical access to facilities, these
cards can also be used to log on to the network and thus to access resources.

[Top](#Index)

# Email_filtering

While email filtering is typically discussed in the context of preventing spam, the organization
must also be concerned about the contents and types of email sent by its users. 

Because
the users are representing the organization in everything they do, you want them to follow
certain guidelines. Email filtering allows for the recognition and the blocking of messages
that contain content that is not compliant with these guidelines. 

Configuring the filtering
solution in such a way that it recognizes and blocks non-compliant emails while also leaving
compliant emails unaffected can be a tremendous challenge.

# Trusted/untrusted_software_sources
Users frequently download and install software and not always from the safest sources.
While policies should definitely reflect the desire of the organization to prevent unauthorized
software downloads and installation, you may have to go beyond policies and implement
a software restriction tool that prevents users from doing this.

If you want to prevent
all downloads and installations by users, you can use a Group Policy in Windows to require
administrator privileges to do any downloading or installing. If your goal is to allow some
installations but not others, you can use additional policies to define exactly which applications
are allowed and which are not.

[Top](#Index)

# Principle_of_least_privilege

The concept of least privilege is a simple one: When assigning permissions, give each
user only the permissions they need to do their work and no more. This is especially
true with administrators. 

Users who need administrative-level permissions should be
assigned two accounts: one for performing nonadministrative, day-to-day tasks and the
other to be used only when performing administrative tasks that specifically require an
administrative-level user account. Those users should be educated on how each of the
accounts should be used.

The biggest benefit to following this policy is the reduction of risk. The biggest headache
is trying to deal with users who may not understand it. A manager, for example, may assert
that he should have more permission than those who report to him, but giving those permissions
to him also opens up all the possibilities for inadvertently deleting files, crippling
accounts, and so forth.

A least-privilege policy should exist, and be enforced, throughout the enterprise. Users
should have only the permissions and privileges needed to do their jobs and no more. ISO
standard 27002 (which updates 17799) sums it up well: **"Privileges should be allocated to individuals on a need-to-use basis and on an event-by-event basis, i.e., the minimum requirement for their functional role when needed."** Adopting this as the policy for your
organization is highly recommended.
