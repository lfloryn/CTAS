# Sound
Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10 have a Control Panel item called
Sound that is used to manage all sound settings. 

You can manage the input devices (microphones,
lines in) and the output devices (speakers, headphones) in one place. Moreover,
you can enable and disable the various Windows sounds that you hear when certain events
occur. Figure  shows the Sound applet.
