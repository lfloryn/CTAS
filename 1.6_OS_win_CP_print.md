# Devices and Printers

In Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10 the Devices And Printers applet
is now the place where printers and other devices are managed. This tool is divided into
three sections with printers in one, multimedia devices in another, and other devices in a
third, as shown in Figure. 

To manage any device, you right-click the device and select
its properties. The printers also can be double-clicked, and you can see what's printing,
manage the print queue, and adjust additional settings.
