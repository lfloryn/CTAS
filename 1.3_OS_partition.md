# Partition

For a hard disk to be able to hold files and programs, it has to be partitioned and formatted.
Partitioning is the process of creating logical divisions on a hard drive. A hard drive
can have one or more partitions. Formatting is the process of creating and configuring a
file allocation table (FAT) and creating the root directory. Several file system types are supported
by the various versions of Windows, such as **FAT16, FAT32**, and **NTFS** (partitions
are explored later in the discussion of disk management).

The partition that the operating system boots from must be designated as active. Only
one partition on a disk may be marked active. Each hard disk can be divided into a total of
four partitions, either four primary partitions or three primary and one extended partition.
Some of the other possibilities are examined in the following sections.


## Dynamic
Partitions can be made dynamic, which—as the name implies—means they can be configured
and reconfigured on the fly. The big benefits they offer are that they can increase in
size (without reformatting) and can span multiple physical disks. Dynamic partitions can
be simple, spanned, or striped.

Dynamic partitions that are simple are similar to primary partitions and logical
drives (which exist on basic partitions, discussed next). This is often the route you
choose when you have only one dynamic disk and want the ability to change allocated
space as needed.

Choosing spanned partitions means that you want space from a number of disks (up to
32) to appear as a single logical volume to users. A minimum of two disks must be used,
and no fault tolerance is provided by this option.

Striped partitions are similar to spanned in that multiple disks are used, but the big
difference is that data is written (in fixed-size stripes) across the disk set in order to
increase I/O performance. Although read operations are faster, a concern is that if one
disk fails, none of the data is retrievable (like Spanned, the Striped option provides no
fault tolerance).

## Basic

With basic storage, Windows drives can be partitioned with primary or logical partitions.
Basic partitions are a fixed size and are always on a single physical disk. This is
the simplest storage solution and has been the traditional method of storing data for
many years.

You can change the size of primary and logical drives by extending them into additional
space on the same disk. You can create up to four partitions on a basic disk, either four primary
or three primary and one extended.

## Primary
A primary partition contains the boot files for an operating system. In older days, the operating
system had to also be on that partition, but with the Windows versions you need to
know for this exam, the OS files can be elsewhere as long as the boot files are in that primary
partition.

Primary partitions cannot be further subdivided.

## Extended
Extended partitions differ from primary in that they can be divided into one or more logical
drives, each of which can be assigned a drive letter.

## Logical
In reality, all partitions are logical in the sense that they don't necessarily correspond to one
physical disk. One disk can have several logical divisions (partitions). A logical partition is
any partition that has a drive letter.

*Sometimes, you will also hear of a logical partition as one that spans multiple
physical disks. For example, a network drive that you know as drive H
might actually be located on several physical disks on a server. To the user,
all that is seen is one drive, or H.*

# GPT
Devices that use the Unifi ed Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) specifi cation (discussed
in the section "BIOS/UEFI settings" in Chapter , "Hardware") instead of a BIOS also use a
partitioning standard called GUID Partition Table (GPT). 

Since 2010, most operating systems
support this and using a master boot record (MBR), which is the alternative method of
booting to a legacy BIOS fi rmware interface. Today, almost all operating systems support
it, and many only support booting from a GPT rather than from an MBR.

Moreover, GPT is also used on some BIOS systems because of the limitations of MBR
partition tables, which was the original driver for the development of UEFI and GPT. MBR
works with disks up to 2 TB in size, but it can't handle larger disks. MBR also supports
only up to four primary partitions, so to have more than four, you had to make one of your
primary partitions an "extended partition" and create logical partitions inside it. 

GPT removes both of these limitations. It allows up to 128 partitions on a GPT drive.
