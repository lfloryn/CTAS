# Compare and contrast the differences of basic Microsoft Windows OS security settings.
### Index 

There is an entire domain dedicated to security for A+. Add to that, CompTIA also provides
security certifications with Security+ and CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner+
(CASP+), so you can see how important this topic is to those creating the exam. Because of
that, make sure you have a good understanding of the topics covered here.
You want to make certain that your Windows systems, and the data within them, are
kept as secure as possible. The security prevents others from changing the data, destroying
it, or inadvertently harming it. This can be done by assigning users the least privileges possible
and hardening as much of the environment as possible. The following are the subobjectives
covered in this section:

- [User and groups](#User_and_groups)
- [NTFS vs. share permissions](#NTFS_vs._share_permissions)
- [Shared files and folders](#Shared_files_and_folders)
- [System files and folders](#System_files_and_folders)
- [User_authentication](#User_authentication)
- [Run as administrator vs. standard user](#Run_as_administrator_vs._standard_user)
- [BitLocker](#BitLocker)
- [BitLocker-To-Go](#BitLocker_To_Go)
- [EFS](#EFS)



# User_and_groups
There are a number of groups created on the operating system by default. The following
sections look at the main ones of these.

## Administrator

The Administrator account is the most powerful of all: It has the power to do everything
from the smallest task all the way up to removing the operating system. Because of the
great power it holds and the fact that it is always created, many who try to do harm will
target this account as the one they try to break into. 

To increase security, during the installation
of the Windows operating systems in question, you are prompted for a name of a
user who will be designated as the Administrator. The power then comes not from being
truly called Administrator (in my case it might now be tmcmillan, mcmillant, or something
similar) but from being a member of the Administrators group (notice the plural for the
group and singular for the user).

Because members of the Administrators group have such power, they can inadvertently
do harm (such as accidentally deleting a fi le that a regular user could not). To protect
against this, the practice of logging in with an Administrators account for daily interaction
is strongly discouraged. Instead, system administrators should log in with a user account
(lesser privileges) and change to the Administrators group account (elevated privileges) only
when necessary for specific tasks.

## Power user
The Power Users group is not as powerful as the Administrators group. Membership in this
group gives read/write permission to the system, allowing members to install most software
but keeping them from changing key operating system fi les. 

This is a good group for those
who need to test software (such as programmers) and junior administrators. While the
Power Users group exists in Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, and 10, it is mostly there for legacy
purposes and no longer has any more privileges than a standard user.

## Guest
The Guest account is created by default (and should be disabled) and is a member of the
Guests group. For the most part, members of Guests have the same rights as Users except
they can't get to log fi les. The best reason to make users members of the Guests group is if
they are accessing the system only for a limited time.

![tip](/img/tip.jpg) As part of operating system security, you should rename the default
Administrator and Guest accounts that are created at installation.

## Standard user
This group is the default that regular users belong to. Members of this group have read/
write permission to their own profi le. They cannot modify system-wide Registry settings
or do much harm outside of their own account. Under the principle of least privilege, users
should be made a member of the Users group only unless qualifying circumstances force
them to have higher privileges.

# NTFS_vs._share_permissions

The **New Technology File System (NTFS)** was introduced with Windows NT to
address security problems. Before Windows NT was released, it had become apparent
to Microsoft that a new fi lesystem was needed to handle growing disk sizes, security
concerns, and the need for more stability than FAT32 provided. NTFS was created to
address those issues.

Although FAT was relatively stable, if the systems that were controlling it kept running,
it didn't do well when the power went out or the system crashed unexpectedly. One of the
benefi ts of NTFS was a transaction tracking system, which made it possible for Windows
NT to back out of any disk operations that were in progress when Windows NT crashed or
lost power.

With NTFS, fi les, directories, and volumes can each have their own security. NTFS's
security is fl exible and built in. Not only does NTFS track security in ACLs, which can
hold permissions for local users and groups, but each entry in the ACL can specify what
type of access is given—such as Read, Write, Modify, or Full Control. This allows a great
deal of fl exibility in setting up a network. In addition, special fi le-encryption programs
were developed to encrypt data while it was stored on the hard disk.

Microsoft strongly recommends that all network shares be established using NTFS.
Several current operating systems from Microsoft support both FAT32 and NTFS. It's
possible to convert from FAT32 to NTFS without losing data, but you can't do the operation
in reverse (you would need to reformat the drive and install the data again from a
backup tape).

![tip](/img/tip.jpg) If you're using FAT32 and want to change to NTFS, the convert utility
will allow you to do so. For example, to change the E drive to NTFS, the
command is convert `e: /FS:NTFS`.

Share permissions apply only when a user is accessing a fi le or folder through the
network. Local permissions and attributes are used to protect the fi le when the user
is local. With FAT and FAT32, you do not have the ability to assign "extended" or
"extensible" permissions, and the user sitting at the console effectively is the owner of
all resources on the system. As such, they can add, change, and delete any data or file
that they want.

With NTFS as the fi lesystem, however, you are allowed to assign more comprehensive
security to your computer system. NTFS permissions are able to protect you at the fi le level.
Share permissions can be applied to the directory level only.

NTFS permissions can affect
users logged on locally or across the network to the system where the NTFS permissions
are applied. Share permissions are in effect only when the user connects to the resource via
the network.

![note](/img/note.jpg) Share and NTFS permissions are not cumulative. Permission must be
granted at both levels to allow access. Moreover, the effective permission
that the user has will be the most restrictive of the combined NTFS permission
and the combined share permissions.

## Allow vs. deny
Within NTFS, permissions for objects fall into one of three categories: allow, not allow,
and deny. When viewing the permissions for a file or folder, you can check the box for
Allow, which effectively allows that group that action. 

You can also uncheck the box for
Allow, which does not allow that group that action. Alternatively, you can check the box
Deny, which prevents that group from using that action. There is a difference between not
allowing (a cleared check box) and Deny (which specifically prohibits), and you tend not to
see Deny used often. Deny, when used, trumps other permissions.

Permissions set at a folder are inherited down through subfolders, unless otherwise
changed. Permissions are also cumulative: if a user is a member of a group that has read
permission and a member of a group that has write permission, they effectively have both
read and write permission.

## Moving vs. copying folders and files
When you copy a file, you create a new entity. When you move a file, you simply relocate it
and still have but one entity. This distinction is important for understanding permissions. A
copy of a file will generally have the permissions assigned to it that are placed on newly created
files in that folder—regardless of what permissions were on the original file.

A moved file, on the other hand, will attempt to keep the same permissions it had in the
original location. Differences will occur if the same permissions cannot exist in the new
location—for example, if you are moving a file from an NTFS volume to FAT32, the NTFS
permissions will be lost. If, on the other hand, you are moving from a FAT32 volume to an
NTFS volume, new permissions will be added that match those for newly created entities.
Folder copy and move operations follow similar guidelines to those with files.

## File attributes
Permissions can be allowed or denied individually on a per-folder basis. You can assign any
combination of the values shown in Table

Clicking the Advanced button allows you to configure auditing and ownership properties.
You can also apply NTFS permissions to individual files. This is done from the
Security tab for the file. Table lists the NTFS file permissions.

# Shared_files_and_folders

You can share folders, and the files within them, by right-clicking them and choosing Share
With (Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows 8) from the context menu. In Windows 7,
the context menu asks who you want to share the folder or file with

Sharing a folder in Windows 7

![ossec](/img/f2.6_Sec_winOs_5.jpg)

The options you see on the context menu will depend on the type of network you are
connected to—a domain, a workgroup, or a Homegroup (the one shown in Figure 7.8). If
you turn on password-protected sharing (the default), the person accessing the share has to
give a username and password to access the shared entity.

The advanced sharing settings will come up if you try to share something in one of
the Public folders or make other changes. This interface, shown in Figure 7.9, can also be
accessed through the Network and Sharing Center applet in the Control Panel and is used
to change network settings relevant to sharing.

## Administrative shares vs. local shares

Administrative shares are created on servers running Windows on the network for administrative
purposes. 

These shares can differ slightly based on which OS is running but always
end with a dollar sign ($) to make them hidden. There is one for each volume on a hard
drive (c$, d$, and so on) as well as admin$ (the root folder, usually c:\windows), and print$
(where the print drivers are located).

 These are created for use by administrators and usually
require administrator privileges to access.

Local shares, as the name implies, are those created locally and are visible with the icon
of a group of two individuals.


![ossec](/img/f2.6_Sec_winOs_3.jpg)

## Permission propagation

As mentioned earlier, permissions are cumulative. A user who is a member of two groups
will effectively have the permissions of both groups combined. In cases where a user has
a Deny permission from a group he is in, that overrules all other permissions he may have
from other groups.

![ossec](/img/f2.6_Sec_winOs_7.jpg)


## Inheritance

Inheritance is the default throughout the permission structure unless a specifi c setting
is created to override this. A user who has read and write permissions in one folder will
have that in all the subfolders unless a change has been made specifi cally to one of the
subfolders.

# System_files_and_folders
System files are usually flagged with the Hidden attribute, which means they don't appear
when a user displays a directory listing. 

You should not change this attribute on a system
file unless absolutely necessary.

System fi les are required for the OS to function. If they are
visible, users might delete them (perhaps thinking they can clear some disk space by deleting
files they don't recognize). Needless to say, that would be a bad thing!

# User_authentication

Users can log into the local operating system, if they have an account, and they will
receive a local access token. The access token the user is granted is locally significant
for the operating system. For example, an administrator (local) that authenticates
against the operating system is only an administrator of that operating system and has
no further network permissions. Every Windows operating system has a local database
and authentication system called the Security Account Manager (SAM),

![ossec](/img/f2.6_Sec_winOs_11.jpg)

Active Directory simplifies the sign-on process for users and lowers the support
requirements for administrators.

 Access can be established through groups and
enforced through group memberships: all users log into the Windows domain using
their centrally created Active Directory account. 

It's important to enforce password
changes and make certain that passwords are updated throughout the organization on
a frequent basis.

Active Directory uses Kerberos v5. A server that runs Active Directory retains information
about all access rights for all users and groups in the network. When a user logs
into Active Directory, they are granted a network access token, also called a Kerberos
token. This token can be used to authenticate against other servers and workstations in the
domain and is accepted network (domain) wide. 

This token is also referred to as the user's
globally unique identifier (GUID). Applications that support Active Directory for authentication
can use this GUID to provide access control.


## Single sign-on
One of the big problems that larger systems must deal with is the need for users to access
multiple systems or applications. This may require a user to remember multiple accounts
and passwords. The purpose of a single sign-on (SSO) is to give users access to all the applications
and systems they need when they log on. This is becoming a reality in many environments,
including Kerberos, Microsoft Active Directory, Novell eDirectory, and some
certifi cate model implementations.

![note](/img/note.jpg)
Single sign-on is both a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing in that once
users are authenticated, they can access all the resources on the network
and browse multiple directories. It's a curse in that it removes the doors
that otherwise exist between the user and various resources.

# Run_as_administrator_vs._standard_user

One of the security recommendations from Microsoft is to have administrative users log
on with a standard user account and, when necessary, elevate the privileges of the account
temporarily to perform a task and then remove that permission when the task is complete.

This is done by running the task, tool, or utility as an administrator. This can be done
by right-clicking the tool and selecting Run as Administrator. 

Once the tool is closed, that
security session ends, and the permissions are returned to those of a standard user. Having
these highly privileged accounts logged in as infrequently as possible helps prevent hackers
from gaining control of these accounts when they are live.

# BitLocker

You have to be careful, because CompTIA sometimes refers to the utility as "bit-locker"
or "Bitlocker," while it is officially known as BitLocker. This tool allows you to use drive
encryption to protect files—including those needed for startup and login. This is available
only with more complete editions of Windows 10 (Pro, Enterprise, and Education),
Windows 8 (Pro and Enterprise), and Windows 7 (Enterprise and Ultimate).

Another requirement is the use of a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The TPM is a chip
on the motherboard that safely stores the encryption key so that the key is not stored on the
encrypted disk. 

BitLocker can mitigate the risk of data loss, because if the disk is separated
from the computer, it is still encrypted and only the TPM with the encryption/decrypting
key can decrypt the disk. This prevents out-of-band attacks on the hard drive, where it
would be mounted and examined on a second system. BitLocker can also sense tampering.

If it senses tampering, the recovery key must be re-entered. The recovery key is either
entered from a printout, loaded from a USB drive in which it was originally saved, or recovered
from your Microsoft account. An option of how the recovery key is stored is presented
to you when you initially turn on BitLocker.

# BitLocker_To_Go

You can also protect removable drives with BitLocker to Go. It provides the same
encryption technology BitLocker uses to help prevent unauthorized access to the files
stored on them. 

You can turn on BitLocker to Go by inserting a USB drive into the
computer and opening the BitLocker Drive Encryption Control Panel applet, as shown
in Figure. When a USB drive is inserted into a Windows computer that contains
BitLocker to Go encryption, the operating system prompts you for the password to
unlock the drive. This password is the password you used originally when you set up
BitLocker to Go on the USB drive.

# EFS
The Encrypting File System (EFS) is an encryption tool built into Windows Vista Business,
Enterprise and Ultimate, Windows 7 (EFS is not fully supported on Windows 7 Starter,
Home Basic, or Home Premium), Windows 8 or 8.1 Professional or Enterprise, and
Windows 10. It allows a user to encrypt files that can be decrypted only by the user who
encrypted the files. It can be used only on NTFS volumes but is simple to use.

To encrypt a file in Windows 8.1, simply right-click the file, access the file properties,
and on the General tab click the Advanced button. That will open the Advanced Attributes
dialog box, as shown in Figure 7.10. On this page, check the Encrypt Contents To Secure
Data box.
