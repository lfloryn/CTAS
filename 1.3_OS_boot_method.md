# Instalation Boot methods

You can begin the installation or upgrade process by booting from a number of sources.

## There are eight in particular that CompTIA wants you to be familiar with:
- USB
- CD-ROM
- DVD
- PXE
- Solid-state or flash drives
- NetBoot
- External/hot swappable drives
- Internal hard drives

## USB
Most systems will allow you to boot from a USB device, but you must often change the
BIOS settings to look for USB first. Using a large USB drive, you can store all the necessary
installation files on the one device and save the time needed to swap media.

## CD-ROM
The option most commonly used for an attended installation is the CD-ROM/DVD boot
(they are identical). Since Windows 7 and newer come only on DVD, though, CD-ROM
applies to older operating systems and not this one.

## DVD
A DVD boot is the most common method of starting an installation.

## PXE
Booting the computer from the network without using a local device creates a **Preboot
Execution Environment (PXE)**. Once it is up, it is common to load the **Windows
Preinstallation Environment (WinPE**) into RAM as a stub operating system and install the
operating system image to the hard drive.
WinPE can be installed onto a bootable CD, USB, or network drive using the
copype.cmd command. This environment can be used in conjunction with a Windows
deployment from a server for unattended installations.

## Solid state/flash drives
If boot files and installation files are located on a solid-state drive or flash drive and the
device is set to look on those drives for boot files, you can boot from these devices and
install the operating system in the same way that you boot from a CD or DVD drive.

## Netboot
NetBoot is a method developed by Apple that allows an Apple device to boot from a network
location rather than from the hard drive. The device uses **Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP)** to receive a network configuration and to receive the IP address of a **Trivial
File Transport protocol (TFTP)** server from which the device will download an operating system
image from a server. This entire process is similar to the way an IP phone learns through
DHCP the IP address of the server from which it downloads its configuration file.

## External/hot-swappable drive
Just as boot files can be located on a USB drive, CD, DVD, and flash drive, they can also
be located on an external hard drive. Most of these drives are also hot-swappable (you can
connect and remove them with the devices on). As always, you will probably have to alter
the boot order of the device so that it looks on the external drive before the other drives if
boot files are also located in these locations.

## Internal hard drive (partition)
Finally, the most common location of boot files is on the internal hard drive. These files are
placed there during the installation and will be executed as long as the device is set to look
for them there. By default most systems are set to look on the internal hard drive first, and
even if the device is not set to look there first, it will eventually boot to those files if there
are no boot files located on any of the other drives or boot sources.
