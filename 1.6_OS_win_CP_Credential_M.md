# Credential Manager

This applet, shown in Figure, allows you to manage the credentials you have saved
when prompted if you would like to save them for a site. 

The web passwords (which are cut
off for security reasons) appear in a list below the heading "Web passwords." When you
select the Windows credentials icon, the same list for Windows credentials appears.
