# ipconfig
The ipconfig command is used to view the IP configuration of a device and, when combined
with certain switches or parameters, can be used to release and renew the lease of
an IP address obtained from a DHCP server and to flush the DNS resolver cache. 

Its most
common use is to view the current configuration. Figure 6.5 shows its execution with the /
all switch, which results in a display of a wealth of information about the IP configuration.

**Using ipconfig**

```dos
ipconfig /all
```

```dos
ipconfig /?
```

```dos
USAGE:
    ipconfig [/allcompartments] [/? | /all | 
                                 /renew [adapter] | /release [adapter] |
                                 /renew6 [adapter] | /release6 [adapter] |
                                 /flushdns | /displaydns | /registerdns |
                                 /showclassid adapter |
                                 /setclassid adapter [classid] |
                                 /showclassid6 adapter |
                                 /setclassid6 adapter [classid] ]

where
    adapter             Connection name 
                       (wildcard characters * and ? allowed, see examples)

    Options:
       /?               Display this help message
       /all             Display full configuration information.
       /release         Release the IPv4 address for the specified adapter.
       /release6        Release the IPv6 address for the specified adapter.
       /renew           Renew the IPv4 address for the specified adapter.
       /renew6          Renew the IPv6 address for the specified adapter.
       /flushdns        Purges the DNS Resolver cache.
       /registerdns     Refreshes all DHCP leases and re-registers DNS names
       /displaydns      Display the contents of the DNS Resolver Cache.
       /showclassid     Displays all the dhcp class IDs allowed for adapter.
       /setclassid      Modifies the dhcp class id.  
       /showclassid6    Displays all the IPv6 DHCP class IDs allowed for adapter.
       /setclassid6     Modifies the IPv6 DHCP class id.


The default is to display only the IP address, subnet mask and
default gateway for each adapter bound to TCP/IP.

For Release and Renew, if no adapter name is specified, then the IP address
leases for all adapters bound to TCP/IP will be released or renewed.

For Setclassid and Setclassid6, if no ClassId is specified, then the ClassId is removed.

Examples:
    > ipconfig                       ... Show information
    > ipconfig /all                  ... Show detailed information
    > ipconfig /renew                ... renew all adapters
    > ipconfig /renew EL*            ... renew any connection that has its 
                                         name starting with EL
    > ipconfig /release *Con*        ... release all matching connections,
                                         eg. "Wired Ethernet Connection 1" or
                                             "Wired Ethernet Connection 2"
    > ipconfig /allcompartments      ... Show information about all 
                                         compartments
    > ipconfig /allcompartments /all ... Show detailed information about all
                                         compartments
```

A scenario in which this command would be valuable is when you are dealing with a
device you have never touched before that is having communication issues. This command
would show a wealth of information with its output.

You can use ipconfig to release and then renew a configuration obtained from a DHCP
server by issuing the following commands:

```dos
ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew
```
It is also helpful to know that when you have just corrected a configuration error (such
as an IP address) on a destination device, you should ensure that the device registers its new
IP address with the DNS server by executing the **ipconfig /registerdns** command.

It may also be necessary to clear incorrect IP addresses to hostname mappings that may
still exist on the devices that were attempting to access the destination device. This can be
done by executing the **ipconfig /flushdns** command.

# Linux
If you are using a **Linux or Unix system**, the command is not ipconfig but **ifconfig**.
Figure shows an example of the command and its output. The **ifconfig** command
with the -a option shows all network interface information, even if the network interface is
down.
