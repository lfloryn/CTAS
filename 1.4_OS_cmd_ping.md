# Ping

The ping command makes use of the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to
test connectivity between two devices. ping is one of the most useful commands in the
TCP/IP suite. 

It sends a series of packets to another system, which in turn sends a
response. The ping command can be extremely useful for troubleshooting problems with
remote hosts.

The ping command indicates whether the host can be reached and how long it took for
the host to send a return packet. On a LAN, the time is indicated as less than 10 milliseconds.

Across WAN links, however, this value can be much greater. When the -a parameter
is included, it will also attempt to resolve the hostname associated with the IP address.
Figure shows an example of a successful ping.

```dos
ping /?
```

```dos
Usage: ping [-t] [-a] [-n count] [-l size] [-f] [-i TTL] [-v TOS]
            [-r count] [-s count] [[-j host-list] | [-k host-list]]
            [-w timeout] [-R] [-S srcaddr] [-c compartment] [-p]
            [-4] [-6] target_name

Options:
    -t             Ping the specified host until stopped.
                   To see statistics and continue - type Control-Break;
                   To stop - type Control-C.
    -a             Resolve addresses to hostnames.
    -n count       Number of echo requests to send.
    -l size        Send buffer size.
    -f             Set Don't Fragment flag in packet (IPv4-only).
    -i TTL         Time To Live.
    -v TOS         Type Of Service (IPv4-only. This setting has been deprecated
                   and has no effect on the type of service field in the IP
                   Header).
    -r count       Record route for count hops (IPv4-only).
    -s count       Timestamp for count hops (IPv4-only).
    -j host-list   Loose source route along host-list (IPv4-only).
    -k host-list   Strict source route along host-list (IPv4-only).
    -w timeout     Timeout in milliseconds to wait for each reply.
    -R             Use routing header to test reverse route also (IPv6-only).
                   Per RFC 5095 the use of this routing header has been
                   deprecated. Some systems may drop echo requests if
                   this header is used.
    -S srcaddr     Source address to use.
    -c compartment Routing compartment identifier.
    -p             Ping a Hyper-V Network Virtualization provider address.
    -4             Force using IPv4.
    -6             Force using IPv6.
