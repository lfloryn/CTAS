# **use Microsoft operating system features and tools.**

This objective requires you to know how to work at the command line and run common
command-line utilities available with the Windows-based operating systems, as well as use
administrative tools. Some of the material here overlaps with other objectives, but you'll
want to make certain you know each utility discussed.

Although most of the information presented about Windows utilities and administration
should seem like second nature to you (on-the-job experience is expected for A+
certification), you should read these sections thoroughly to make certain you can answer
any questions that may appear about them. The topics covered in this section include the
following:

- [Administrative](1.5_OS_win_Administrative.md)
- [MSConfig](1.5_OS_win_msconfig.md)
- [Task Manager](1.5_OS_win_taskmanager.md)
- [Disk Management](1.5_OS_win_DiskManagement.md)
- System utilities
