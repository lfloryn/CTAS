# Network shares/administrative shares/mapping drives

Network shares can be mapped to drives to appear as if the resources are local. 

The [NET USE](1.4_OS_cmd_netuse.md) command is used to establish network connections via a command prompt.

 For
example, to connect to a shared network drive and make it your M drive, you would use
the syntax 


```dos
net use m: \\server\share.
```

This can also be done in [File Explorer](1.4_OS_cmd_netuse.md).

NET USE can also be used to connect to a shared printer: 

```dos
net use lpt1: \\printername.
```


An administrative share is one that is hidden to those file browsing. To connect to these
drives, you must reference the name of the drive. While you can create a hidden drive at any
time simply by adding a dollar sign at the end of its name, there are some default administrative
drives.

Next Table gives you information on the default administrative drives.
