# **Compare and contrast common operating system types and their purposes.**

## 32-bit vs. 64-bit
    - The primary difference between 32-bit and 64-bit computing is the amount of data the processor (CPU) is able to process effectively. To run a 64-bit version of the operating system, you must have a 64-bit processor. To find out whether you are running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows, you can look at the information shown in the System applet in the Control Panel in any of the Windows versions you need to know for this exam. 
    - Other differences between 64-bit and 32-bit systems are their hardware requirements and the types of applications you can run on them. You can run a 32-bit application on either a 64-bit or 32-bit operating system, but you can only run 64-bit applications on a 64-bit system. 

## RAM limitations
    - All operating systems have a minimum amount of RAM required to operate. It's not just a matter of functioning well; if you don't have that minimum memory, it won't install! 
    - Always consult the documentation to ensure that you meet this requirement. 
    - There is also a maximum amount of memory that an operating system can use, which is also useful to know. There is no use wasting memory in a device in which the operating system simply ignores it. The documentation that comes with the operating system will tell how much memory the system can support.
