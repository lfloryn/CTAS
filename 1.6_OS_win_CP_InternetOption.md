# Internet Options

## The configuration settings for Internet Options provide a number of Internet connectivity possibilities. The tabs here include connections, Security, General, Privacy, Content, Programs, and Advanced.

## Connections
As the name implies, from this tab you can configure connections for an Internet
connection, a dial-up or VPN connection, and LAN settings, as shown in Figure 

The Connections tab

A scenario for using this tool would be when a user needs you to configure his laptop
with a VPN connection to the office.

## Security

On the Security tab, as shown in Figure, you can choose both a zone and a security
level for the zone. The zones include Internet, Local Intranet, Trusted Sites, and Restricted
Sites. The default security level for most of the zones is between High and Medium-High,
but you can also select lower levels.

The Security tab

A scenario in which you would use this tool is when a user wants more secure settings
on his Internet connection while loosening the settings somewhat for his home network.

## General

On the General tab, as shown in Figure, you can configure the home page that appears
when the browser starts or a new tab is opened. You can also configure the history settings,
search defaults, what happens by default when new tabs are opened, and the appearance of
the browser (colors, languages, fonts, and accessibility).


The General tab

A scenario for using this tool is when a user would like to change his home page to the
company intranet site.

## Privacy

Privacy settings, as shown in Figure, allow you to configure the privacy level, choose
whether you want to provide location information, use Pop-up Blocker, and disable toolbars
(and extensions) when InPrivate Browsing starts.

The Privacy tab

A scenario for using this tool would be when a user needs to disable pop-ups for a site
that requires them to function properly.

## Programs

On the Programs tab, as shown in Figure 6.40, you specify which browser you want to be
the default browser, what editor to use if HTML needs editing, and what programs to associate
with various file types. You can also manage add-ons from here.

The Programs tab

![IO](/img/f1.6_CP_Internet5.jpg)


A scenario for using this tool is when a user has an unusual file type that his system
doesn't recognize. You could use this tool to associate the file type with the application that
opens it.

## Advanced

On the Advanced tab, as shown in Figure 6.41, you can reset settings to their default
options. You can also toggle configuration settings for granular settings not found on
other tabs.

The Advanced tab

A scenario for using this tab would be when a user has played with the settings and
would like to get them back to the default; this tool will do it.
