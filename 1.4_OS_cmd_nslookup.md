# nslookup
The nslookup command is a command-line administrative tool for testing and troubleshooting
DNS servers. It can be run in two modes, interactive and noninteractive. While
noninteractive mode is useful when only a single piece of data needs to be returned, interactive
allows you to query for either an IP address for a name or a name for an IP address
without leaving nslookup mode.

A common scenario for using nslookup is when a system cannot resolve names and you
need to see what DNS server it is using.

The command syntax is as follows:

```dos
nslookup [-option] [hostname] [server]

nslookup [<-SubCommand ...>] [{<computerTofind> | -<Server>}]
nslookup /exit
nslookup /finger [<UserName>] [{[>] <FileName>|[>>] <FileName>}]
nslookup /{help | ?}
nslookup /ls [<Option>] <DNSDomain> [{[>] <FileName>|[>>] <FileName>}]
nslookup /lserver <DNSDomain> 
nslookup /root 
nslookup /server <DNSDomain>
nslookup /set <KeyWord>[=<Value>]
nslookup /set all 
nslookup /set class=<Class>
nslookup /set [no]d2
nslookup /set [no]debug
nslookup /set [no]defname
nslookup /set domain=<DomainName>
nslookup /set [no]ignore
nslookup /set port=<Port>
nslookup /set querytype=<ResourceRecordtype>
nslookup /set [no]recurse
nslookup /set retry=<Number>
nslookup /set root=<RootServer>
nslookup /set [no]search
nslookup /set srchlist=<DomainName>[/...]
nslookup /set timeout=<Number>
nslookup /set type=<ResourceRecordtype>
nslookup /set [no]vc
nslookup /view <FileName>
```

To enter interactive mode, simply enter nslookup as shown next. When you do this, by
default it will identify the IP address and name of the DNS server that the local machine
is configured to use, if any, and then will go to the > prompt. At this prompt you can enter
either an IP address or a name, and the system will attempt to resolve the IP address to a
name or the name to an IP address.

```dos
C:\> nslookup
Default Server: nameserver1.domain.com
Address: 10.0.0.1
>
```

The following are other queries that can be run that may prove helpful when troubleshooting
name resolution issues:

- Looking up different data types in the database (such as Microsoft records). For example,
the following command will filter for mail server records:

```dos
C:\>Nslookup
Set Type=mx
```

- Querying directly from another name server (different from the one the local device is
configured to use). The command for the DNS server named some.dns.server in the
somewhere.com domain is as follows:

```dos
nslookup somewhere.com some.dns.server
```

- Performing a zone transfer. This example is from wayne.net to dns.wayne.net:

```dos
C:\>nslookup
set Type=any
> ls -d wayne.net > dns.wayne.net
> exit
```
