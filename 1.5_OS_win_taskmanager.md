# Task Manager

This tool lets you shut down nonresponsive applications selectively in all Windows versions.
In current versions of Windows, it can do much more. 

Task Manager allows you to see
which processes and applications are using the most system resources, view network usage,
see connected users, and so on. 

To display Task Manager, press Ctrl+Alt+Del and click the
Task Manager button. You can also right-click an empty spot in the taskbar and choose
Task Manager from the pop-up menu that appears.

![note](/img/note.jpg)  To get to the Task Manager directly in any of the Windows versions, you
can press **Ctrl+Shift+Esc**.

In Windows 7, Task Manager has six tabs: Applications, Processes, Performance,
Networking, and Users. The Networking tab is shown only if your system has a network
card installed (it is rare to find one that doesn't). 

The Users tab is displayed only if the computer
you are working on is a member of a workgroup or is a stand-alone computer. The
Users tab is unavailable on computers that are members of a network domain. 

In Windows
8, 8.1, and 10, there is an additional tab called Details, and the Applications tab is replaced
with the App History tab. Let's look at these tabs, in the order of their appearance, in more
detail in Windows 8.1.

## Applications

The Applications tab  lets you see which tasks are open on the
machine. You also see the status of each task, which can be either Running or Not
Responding. If a task or application has stopped responding (that is, it's hung), you can
select the task in the list and click End Task. Doing so closes the program, and you can try
to open it again.

 Often, although certainly not always, if an application hangs, you have
to reboot the computer to prevent the same thing from happening again shortly after you
restart the application. You can also use the Applications tab to switch to a different task
or create new tasks.

App History (Windows 8, 8.1, and 10 Only)
The App History tab in Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10 displays the history of the usage of Metro apps only.

## Processes

The Processes tab (shown in Figure 6.22) lets you see the names of all the processes
running on the machine. You also see the user account that's running the process, as
well as how much CPU and RAM resources each process is using. To end a process,
select it in the list and click End Process. Be careful with this choice, since ending some
processes can cause Windows to shut down. If you don't know what a particular process
does, you can look for it in any search engine and find a number of sites that will
explain it.

**The Processes tab**

You can also change the priority of a process in Task Manager's Processes display by
right-clicking the name of the process and choosing Set Priority.

    In Windows 10, setting the priority is done on the Details tab.

## The six priorities, from lowest to highest, are as follows:

**Low** For applications that need to complete sometime but that you don't want interfering
with other applications. On a numerical scale from 0 to 31, this equates to a base priority of 4.

**Below Normal** For applications that don't need to drop all the way down to Low. This
equates to a base priority of 6.

**Normal** The default priority for most applications. This equates to a base priority of 8.

**Above Normal** For applications that don't need to boost all the way to High. This equates
to a base priority of 10.

**High** For applications that must complete soon, when you don't want other applications
to interfere with the application's performance. This equates to a base priority of 13.

**Realtime** For applications that must have the processor's attention to handle time-critical
tasks. Applications can be run at this priority only by a member of the Administrators
group. This equates to a base priority of 24.


If you decide to change the priority of an application, you'll be warned that changing
the priority of an application may make it unstable. You can generally ignore this warning
when changing the priority to Low, Below Normal, Above Normal, or High, but you
should heed it when changing applications to the Realtime priority. Realtime means that
the processor gives precedence to this process over all others—over security processes, over
spooling, over everything—and is sure to make the system unstable.

Task Manager changes the priority only for that instance of the running application.
The next time the process is started, priorities revert to that of the base (typically Normal).

## Services

The Services tab lists the name of each running service, as well as
the process ID associated with it, its description, its status, and its group. A button labeled
Services appears on this tab, and clicking it will open the MMC console for Services, where
you can configure each service. Within Task Manager, right-clicking a service will open a
context menu listing three choices: Start Service, Stop Service, and Go To Process (which
takes you to the Processes tab).

## Performance

The Performance tab  contains a variety of information, including
overall CPU usage percentage, a graphical display of CPU usage history, page-fi le usage in
megabytes, and a graphical display of page-fi le usage.

This tab also provides you with additional memory-related information such as physical
and kernel memory usage, as well as the total number of handles, threads, and processes.
Total, limit, and peak commit-charge information also displays. 

Some of the items are
beyond the scope of this book, but it's good to know that you can use the Performance tab
to keep track of system performance. Note that the number of processes, CPU usage percentage,
and commit charge always display at the bottom of the Task Manager window,
regardless of which tab you have currently selected.

![note](/img/note.jpg)
In Windows 7 this pane has a button marked Resource Monitor, which
breaks down resource usage on a per-process basis.

## Networking

The Networking tab ) provides you with a graphical display of the
performance of your network connection. It also tells you the network adapter name, link
speed, and state. If you have more than one network adapter installed in the machine, you
can select the appropriate adapter to see graphical usage data for that adapter.

## Users

The Users tab provides you with information about the users connected
to the local machine. You'll see the username, ID, status, client name, and session
type. You can right-click any connected user to perform a variety of functions, including
sending the user a message, disconnecting the user, logging off the user, and initiating a
remote-control session to the user's machine.

**The Users tab**

    Windows 10 has only the functions Disconnect and Manage User Accounts.

Use Task Manager whenever the system seems bogged down by an unresponsive
application.

**Details (Windows 8, 8.1, and 10 Only)**

The Details tab  displays information about the processes that are
running on the computer. A process can be an application that you start or subsystems and
services that are managed by the operating system.

A scenario for using Task Manager is when you have a performance issue and you want
to determine which compute resource (memory, disk, network, CPU) is overtaxed. By
observing the percentage of use of each resource, you can first determine which resource is
the problem and then locate the process that is using most of that resource.
