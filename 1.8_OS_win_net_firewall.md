# Firewall settings

Windows Firewall **(Start ➢ Control Panel ➢ Windows Firewall)** is used to block access from
the network. In Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10, it is divided into separate settings for private
networks and public networks.

# Exceptions
Exceptions are configured as variations from the rules. Windows Firewall will block incoming
network connections except for the programs and services that you choose to allow
through. 

For example, you can make an exception for Remote Assistance to allow communication
from other computers when you need help (the scope of the exception can be set to
allow any computer, only those on the network, or a custom list of allowed addresses you
create). Exceptions can include programs as well as individual ports.

A scenario for using exceptions would be when you want to block all traffic with the
exception of only required traffic. You define each allowed traffic type as an exception and
disallow all others by default.

# Configuration
Most of the configuration is done as network connection settings. You can configure both
ICMP and Services settings. Examples of ICMP settings include allowing incoming echo
requests, allowing incoming router requests, and allowing redirects. Examples of services
often configured include an FTP server, Post-Office Protocol Version 3 (POP3), and web
server (HTTP).

A scenario for using this setting is to disallow ICMP traffic to prevent ping sweeps. This
type of network probing is used to discover the devices in your network.

# Enabling/disabling Windows Firewall 

[enable/disable firewall](1.6_OS_win_CP_firewall.md)

On the General tab of Windows Firewall, it is possible to choose the radio button Off (Not
Recommended). As the name implies, this turns Windows Firewall completely off. The
other radio button option, On (Recommended), enables the firewall. You can also toggle
the check box Don't Allow Exceptions. This option should be enabled when you're connecting
to a public network in an unsecure location (such as an airport or library), and it will
then ignore any exceptions that were configured.

A scenario where you might choose to turn the firewall off is when you are using
another firewall product instead. You want to use only one firewall.
