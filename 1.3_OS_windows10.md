# Upgrading to Windows 10

With Windows 10, the in-place upgrade is now a first-class deployment option and is
now the preferred approach for Windows 10 deploymentâ€”even in enterprises. It allows
Windows 10 installations to be initiated from within the existing Windows 7 or newer OS.

## Windows Upgrade OS Advisor

The Windows Upgrade Advisor from Microsoft can be useful in any upgrade process. It
will check your system, verify that it can run the desired operating system, and give you a
report of any identified compatibility issues. There are versions under various names for
Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10.
