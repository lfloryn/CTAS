# Workgroup vs. domain setup
When installing an operating system, by default the device will be placed in a workgroup.

This is a small group of devices that might represent, for example, a **home network** or
a **SOHO network** . 

In an organization, however, the devices will more likely reside in a
domain. A domain is Windows grouping made possible when using **Active Directory**, the
Windows Directory service. 

Placing a device in a domain was covered earlier in this chapter
in the section "Domain access."

## The following versions of Windows support joining a domain:

- Windows 7 Professional
- Windows 7 Ultimate
- Windows 7 Enterprise
- Windows 8 Professional
- Windows 8.21 Professional
- Windows 10 Professional
- Windows 10 Enterprise
