# Detect, remove, and prevent malware using appropriate tools and methods.
### Index 

This objective explores security threats and vulnerabilities. A number of important topics
are discussed in this section that fall into the realm of two broad categories: social
engineering and malware. 

You'll look at malware and then several different types of
attacks, as well as some of the reasons your network is vulnerable. 

This list is far from
inclusive because new variants of each are being created by miscreants on a regular basis.
The list does, however, include everything CompTIA expects you to know for the exam.
Subobjectives covered in this section include the following:

# Social_engineering

Social engineering is a process in which an attacker attempts to acquire information about
your network and system by social means, such as by talking to people in the organization.
A social-engineering attack may occur over the phone, by email, or by a visit. 

The intent is
to acquire access information, such as user IDs and passwords. When the attempt is made
through email or instant messaging, it is known as phishing (discussed later) and often is
made to look as if it is coming from sites where users are likely to have accounts (eBay and
PayPal are popular).

These types of attacks are relatively low-tech and are more akin to con jobs. Take the following
example. Your help desk gets a call at 4 a.m. from someone purporting to be the vice
president of your company. She tells the help-desk personnel that she is out of town to attend
a meeting, her computer just failed, and she is sitting in a hotel trying to get a file from her
desktop computer back at the office. She can't seem to remember her password and user ID.

She tells the help-desk representative that she needs access to the information right away or
the company could lose millions of dollars. Your help-desk rep knows how important this
meeting is and gives the vice president her user ID and password over the phone.

Another common approach is initiated by a phone call or email from your software vendor,
telling you that they have a critical fi x that must be installed on your computer system.
If this patch isn't installed right away, your system will crash and you'll lose all your data.
For some reason, you've changed your maintenance account password and they can't log
on. Your system operator gives the password to the person. You've been hit again.

## Phishing

Phishing is a form of social engineering in which you simply ask someone for a piece of
information that you are missing by making it look as if it is a legitimate request. An email
might look as if it is from a bank and contain some basic information, such as the user's
name. 

In the email, it will often state that there is a problem with the person's account or
access privileges. They will be told to click a link to correct the problem. After they click
the link—which goes to a site other than the bank's—they are asked for their username,
password, account information, and so on. The person instigating the phishing can then
use the values entered there to access the legitimate account.

One of the best counters to phishing is to simply mouse over the Click Here
link and read the URL. Almost every time it is pointing to an adaptation of
the legitimate URL as opposed to a link to the real thing.

The only preventive measure in dealing with social-engineering attacks is to educate
your users and staff to never give out passwords and user IDs over the phone or via email
or to anyone who isn't positively verifi ed as being who they say they are.

When you combine phishing with Voice over IP (VoIP), it becomes known as vishing and
is just an elevated form of social engineering. While crank calls have been in existence since
the invention of the telephone, the rise in VoIP now makes it possible for someone to call you
from almost anywhere in the world, without the worry of tracing, caller ID, and other features
of the land line, and pretend to be someone they are not in order to get data from you.

## Spear phishing
Two other forms of phishing to be aware of are spear phishing and whaling , and they are
similar in nature. With spear phishing, the person conducting it uses information that
the target would be less likely to question because it appears to be coming from a trusted
source. 

As an example, instead of Wells Fargo sending you a message telling you to click
here to fi x a problem with your account, the message that comes in appears to be from your
spouse and it says to click here to see a video of your children from last Christmas.

 Because
it appears far more likely to be a legitimate message, it cuts through the user's standard
defenses like a spear and has a higher likelihood of being clicked. 

Generating the attack
requires much more work on the part of the miscreant and often involves using information
from contact lists, friend lists from social media sites, and so on.

Whaling is nothing more than phishing, or spear phishing, for big users. Instead of
sending out a To Whom It May Concern message to thousands of users, the whaler identifi
es one person from whom they can gain all the data they want—usually a manager or
owner—and targets the phishing campaign at them.

## Impersonation

Impersonation occurs when an individual pretends to be an IT technician, heating and air
repairman, or other personnel to get in the facility or to convince someone to disclose sensitive
information.

## Shoulder surfing
Shoulder surfi ng involves nothing more than watching someone when they enter their sensitive
data. They can see you entering a password, typing in a credit card number, or entering
any other pertinent information. 

![note](/img/note.jpg) The best defense against this type of attack is simply
to survey your environment before entering personal data. Privacy fi lters can be used that
make the screen difficult to read unless you are directly in front of it.

## Tailgating

Tailgating is the term used for someone being so close to you when you enter a building
that they are able to come in right behind you without needing to use a key, a card, or any
other security device. Many social-engineering intruders who need physical access to a site
will use this method of gaining entry. Educate users to beware of this and other socialengineering
ploys and prevent them from happening.

![note](/img/note.jpg) Mantraps are a great way to stop tailgating. A mantrap is a series of two
doors with a small room between them that helps prevent unauthorized
people from entering a building. For more information, see the earlier section
"Mantrap."

## Dumpster diving

It is amazing the information that can be gleaned from physical documents even in the age
when there is such a push to go paperless. Dumpster diving is a common physical access
method. Companies normally generate a huge amount of paper, most of which eventually
winds up in dumpsters or recycle bins.

Dumpsters may contain information that is highly
sensitive in nature (such as passwords after a change and before the user has the new one
memorized). In high-security and government environments, sensitive papers should be
either shredded or burned. Most businesses don't do this.

In addition, the advent of "green"
companies has created an increase in the amount of recycled paper, which can often contain
all kinds of juicy information about a company and its individual employees.

# DDoS
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is one in which the attacker recruits additional
devices (called zombies ) to assist in the attack. This greatly magnifi es the effect of
the denial of service.

# DoS
A denial-of-service (DoS) attack is one in which the attacker's goal is to make the device
unavailable to do its job. It consumes all the resources of the device leaving none for its

# Zero-day
Vulnerabilities are often discovered in live environments before a fix or patch exists. Such
vulnerabilities are referred to as zero-day vulnerabilities. A zero-day attack is one that
occurs when a security vulnerability in an application is discovered on the same day the
application is released. Monitoring known hacking community websites can often provide
an early alert because hackers often share zero-day exploit information.

New zero-day attacks are announced on a regular basis against a broad range of technology
systems. You should create an inventory of applications and maintain a list of critical
systems to manage the risks of these attack vectors.

# Man-in-the-middle

A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack is one in which the hacker uses one of several techniques
to position himself in the middle of a current communication session between two
devices. 

One way he might do this is by polluting the ARP cache (mappings of IP addresses
to MAC addresses) such that the users on either end of the session think they are sending
data to one another when in reality they are sending it to the hacker. This allows the hacker
to monitor the entire conversation.

# Brute_force

A brute-force attack is a password attack that operates by attempting every possible combination
of characters that could be in a password. These can be performed online or offline.

Given enough time and processing power, any password can be cracked, so most enterprises
use some sort of password policy that locks an account after a certain number of
incorrect attempts. For this reason, online attacks are largely unsuccessful.

In contrast, the offline mode of the attack requires the attacker to steal the password
file first but enables an unconstrained guessing of passwords, free of any application- or
network-related rate limitations.

# Dictionary
Dictionary attacks rely on the use of large files that contain words from the dictionary.
These attacks are most often attempts to crack an encrypted password by encrypting each
word in the dictionary file using the same algorithm used to encrypt the users' passwords
and then comparing this value to the encrypted password for a match. These attacks are
performed offline to eliminate the disabling of the account through password policies.

# Rainbow_table
Rainbow tables are used to speed the process of comparing captured password hashes to
character combinations. In the absence of a rainbow table, the process is to take the character
combination, hash it, and compare the hash. A rainbow table is a list of character combinations
that have been pre-hashed. 

Salting the password, or adding a random character
before hashing, can help defeat the use of rainbow tables.

# Spoofing

Spoofing is the process of masquerading as another user or device. It is usually done for
the purpose of accessing a resource to which the hacker should not have access or to get
through a security device such as a firewall that may be filtering traffic based on a source IP
address.

Spoofing can take various forms. The hacker may change her IP address to one that
belongs to a trusted user or device to get through a firewall filtering at the IP layer. In
other cases, she might spoof the MAC address of a trusted device to defeat layer 2 security
applied on a switch or wireless access point (AP).

It could also be the spoofing of a
username and password to access a resource. Finally, it might be the spoofing of an email
address to launch one of the email-based attacks.

# Non-compliant_systems
Upon infection, some viruses destroy the target system immediately. The saving grace is
that the infection can be detected and corrected. Some viruses won't destroy or otherwise
tamper with a system; they use the victim system as a carrier.

 The victim system then
infects servers, file shares, and other resources with the virus. The carrier then infects the
target system again. Until the carrier is identified and cleaned, the virus continues to harass
systems in this network and spread.

You should use some type of enterprise-grade malware management system that scans
the network for non-compliant devices. Most of these systems can automate the entire process
of locating, isolating, and remediating non-compliant devices.
