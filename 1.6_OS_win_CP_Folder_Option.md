# Folder Options

This dialog box lets you configure how folders are displayed in Windows Explorer.

## View hidden files

On the View tab, shown in Figure 6.44, beneath Advanced Settings, you can choose the
option Show Hidden Files, Folders, And Drives, and this will allow you to see those items.

The opposite of this—the default setting—is Don't Show Hidden Files, Folders, Or Drives.

Radio buttons allow you to choose only one of these options.

A related check box that you should also clear in order to see all files is Hide Protected
Operating System Files (Recommended) . When this check box
is cleared, those files will also appear in the view you are seeing.

Hiding these files is recommended so that users do not inadvertently delete or change
these critical files. Hiding them is the default setting.

## Hide extensions

On the View tab, shown in Figure, you must clear the check box Hide Extensions For
Known File Types in order for the extensions to be shown with the files.


## General options

You can configure the layout on the General tab of Folder Options (shown in Figure ).

Browsing options allow you to choose whether each folder will open in its own folder or
the same folder. The Navigation Pane setting allows you to control what items are included
in the tree structure that appears to the left when using File Explorer.

## View options

Along with the setting that allows you to hide or show file extensions and to show hidden
files are a number of other settings that affect what you see when you use File Explorer (as
shown in Figure earlier).

Always Show Icons, Never Thumbnails Always show icons, rather than thumbnail previews
of files. Use this setting if thumbnail previews are slowing down your computer.

Always Show Menus Always show menus above the toolbar. Use this setting if you want
access to the classic menus, which are hidden by default.

**Display File** Icon On Thumbnails Always shows the icon for a file in addition to the
thumbnail (for easier access to the related program).

**Display File Size**Information In Folder Tips See the size of a folder in a tip when you
point to the folder.

**Hide Protected** Operating System Files See all system files that are usually hidden from view.

**Hide Empty Drives**In The Computer Folder Show removable media drives (such as card
readers) in the Computer folder even if they currently don't have media inserted.

information when you point to files.

in the preview pane. Use this setting to improve the performance of your computer or if you
don't want to use the preview pane.

**Use Check Boxes** To Select Items Add check boxes to file views for easier selection of several
files at once. This can be useful if it's difficult for you to hold down the Ctrl key while
clicking to select multiple files.
