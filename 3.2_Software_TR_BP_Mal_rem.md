# Use best practice procedures for malware removal.
### Index 

Over time best practices have been developed through trial and error that help minimize
the chances of getting viruses and reduce the effort involved in getting rid of malware.
Some of these practices are discussed in this section. 

The topics addressed in this objective include the following:

- [1. Identify and research malware symptoms.](#1._Identify_and_research_malware_symptoms)
- [2. Quarantine the infected systems.](#2._Quarantine_the_infected_systems)
- [3. Disable System Restore (in Windows).](#3.__Disable_System_Restore_(in_Windows))
- [4. Remediate the infected systems.](#4._Remediate_the_infected_systems)
- [5. Schedule scans and run updates.](#5._Schedule_scans_and_run_updates)
- [6. Enable System Restore and create a restore point (in Windows).](#6.__Enable_System_Restore_and_create_a_restore_point_(in_Windows))
- [7. Educate the end user.](#7._Educate_the_end_user)

# 1._Identify_and_research_malware_symptoms

First identify the symptoms the malware is producing as clearly as you can. This can help
identify the exact virus in some cases. In many scenarios, identifying the symptoms can
help establish the severity of the infection, which is good to determine when IT resources
are stretched thin and battles must be chosen.

Before doing anything major, it is imperative first to be sure that you are dealing with the
right issue. If you suspect malware, try to identify the type (spyware, virus, and so on) and
look for the proof needed to substantiate that it is indeed the culprit.

Identifying malware is no different from the troubleshooting you learned about. You first need to identify the problem. 

This can be done with a multitude of
tools, but hopefully your antivirus/anti-malware software will be the first tool that helps to
identify the problem. If the antivirus/anti-malware software fails to identify the problem,
then other third-party tools must be used.

# 2._Quarantine_the_infected_systems

The infected system should be quarantined—removed from the network to prevent a spread
of the infection to other systems. 

This is why it is a good practice to keep data on servers so
that when user systems need to be quarantined, a new machine can be quickly imaged for
the user to reduce the impacts on productivity while the infected machine is cleaned.

# 3.__Disable_System_Restore_(in_Windows)

System Restore is a useful tool in many cases, but when a virus infection occurs, it can be an
ally of the virus. 

Virus scanners cannot clean infections from restore points, making reinfection
possible. If a system restore is performed after running an antispyware utility, viral objects
may reappear. 

Disable System Restore before attempting to clean a system. When you do this,
you will delete all restore points in the system, including any that may have an infection.

Most ransomware will dump your restore points for you, since you could
potentially recover the operating system and then recover files using your
previous versions.

# 4._Remediate_the_infected_systems

Once the infected system has been quarantined, you must take steps to clean it. This twostep
process is discussed in this section.

**a. Update the anti-malware software.**

Before scanning the system with antivirus software, update the software and the engine if
necessary. Definition files can change daily, and the virus may be so new that it is not contained
in your current definitions file even if it is only a week old.

**b. Scan and use removal techniques (safe mode, pre-installation environment).**

Although you can run the scan and removal from the GUI, it is a best practice to do this
either after booting to safe mode or from a pre-installation environment like Windows PE.
Viruses that evade detection in the GUI cannot do so as easily in either of these
environments.

Depending on the type of virus or malware, you may need to boot into Safe Mode or
the Windows Recovery Environment (as discussed previously in this chapter). However,
the remediation of the virus or malware will be different for each situation. Windows
Defender Security can automatically perform an offl ine scan. 

To perform an offl ine scan,
click the task tray in the lower-right corner, then right-click the shield, then View Security
Dashboard, then Virus & Threat Protection, then Virus & Threat Protection Settings,
then Run a New Advanced Scan, and fi nally Windows Defender Offl ine Scan.

Windows Defender Offline scan

After you confirm that you will save your work by clicking Scan on the confirmation
dialog box, the UAC will prompt you to answer Yes, and then Windows will reboot. The
Windows Recovery Environment will boot and Windows Defender Antivirus will run.

In some situations, such as in a ransomware attack, no remediation can be performed
because the user files are encrypted. In these cases, the malware should be removed
from the operating system, and then the user data must be restored from a backup. The
unfortunate and terrifying fact when it comes to ransomware is that there will be loss of
work.

In many instances, remediating the virus or malware is impossible because no one
knows for sure what the virus or malware actually does. Antivirus researchers can document
the delivery system that a virus or malware uses to enter your system. 

You can then
patch the vulnerability, which is part of the remediation process. What antivirus research
cannot do most of the time is to document the payload of a virus or malware. 

This is
because most of the time it is encrypted and is changed, depending on the need of its creator.
In these cases, the remediation might be to sanitize the drive and reinstall the operating
system from an image or manually install it.

# 5._Schedule_scans_and_run_updates

The antivirus software can be scheduled to perform a scan of the system. You should set
this up to occur when the system is not in use, like at night. The scanning process will go
faster then and will not affect users. Also, set the software to automatically check for and
install any updates to the definition files and to the engine when available.

The odds of the system never being confronted by malware again are slim. To reduce the
chances of it being infected again, schedule scans and updates to run regularly. Most antimalware
programs can be configured to run automatically at specific intervals; however,
should you encounter one that does not have such a feature, you can run it through Task
Scheduler.

Windows Defender Security is scheduled to automatically scan the operating system
during idle times. However, if you want to schedule a scan, you can use Task Scheduler
by clicking the Start menu, then typing Task Scheduler and then select Task Scheduler
from the results, then open the Task Scheduler Library, then Microsoft, then Windows,
then Windows Defender, then double-click Windows Defender Scheduled Scan, then the
Triggers tab, then New… , then select Weekly, then choose the day of the week, and then
finally select OK.

# 6.__Enable_System_Restore_and_create_a_restore_point_(in_Windows)

Although it is recommended that you disable System Restore before cleaning an infection,
it is a good idea to create a restore point after an infection is cleaned. This gives you a clean
restore point going forward in case the system becomes infected again at some point. For
non-Windows systems, a backup should be performed at this time.

# 7._Educate_the_end_user

In many cases, users are partly responsible for the virus infection. After an infection occurs
is a great time to impress on users the principles of secure computing. They should be
reminded that antivirus software and firewalls can go only so far in protecting them and
that they should exercise safe browsing habits and refrain from opening any attachments in
email from unknown sources, regardless of how tempting.

Education should always be viewed as the final step. The end user needs to understand
what led to the malware infestation and what to avoid, or look for, in the future to keep it
from happening again. This training can be formal training in a classroom setting, or it can
be an online training in which the user must participate and answer questions.

It is common for large companies to require annual or bi-annual end-user training
for threats. It is becoming more common for training to be done online, and a number
of companies offer this as a service. 

It is not uncommon for a company to send a
phishing attempt to their employees. When an employee falls for the phishing attempt,
they are automatically signed up for mandatory training. Incentives are also common,
such as the first employee that notifies the IT department of the phishing attempt gets
a gift card.
