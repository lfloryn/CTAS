# Summarize application installation and configuration concepts.

When installing applications, there are a number of considerations. This objective consists of the following topics:

- System requirements
- OS requirements
- Methods of installation and deployment
- Local user permissions
- Security considerations


# System requirements
Every application has minimum system requirements with regard to computing resources.

The two most critical to proper operation are covered in this section.

# Drive space

Consult the documentation of the software to determine the minimum amount of disk
space required to hold the installation. These minimums are not suggestions; the software
will simply not install if they are not met.

# RAM
The minimum of RAM required should be viewed as just that, a minimum. Make sure you
have more than required for satisfactory performance.

# OS requirements
Beyond the disk space and RAM, there are operating system considerations as well.

# Compatibility

As mentioned earlier, applications are written to be compatible with various operating systems
and the compatibility with your system must be ensured.

# Methods of installation and deployment

There are a couple of ways the installation files may be introduced to your system. Let's
look at the two most common.

# Local (CD/USB)

Outside of the enterprise, most installations are done by using the CD that came with the
software or by placing these same files on a USB stick and accessing them from the USB
drive.

# Network-based
In most enterprises, installations are done by placing the installation files in a network location
and accessing and running them from the network location. 

This saves administrative
effort involved in visiting each machine manually with the installation CD.

# Local user permissions
Keep in mind that administrative privileges will be required to install software. This is
typically not an issue in the home since users are typically administrators of their local
machine. In the enterprise, however, that may not be the case and should be a consideration
when deploying software.

# Folder/file access for installation
When a network location has been configured as an installation point, ensure that users
that will be accessing the share have the proper permissions to the folder holding the installation
files. They must be able to execute the files in the folder.

# Security considerations
Applications can serve as a security opening to hackers. Always research and consider the
relative security of an application.

# Impact to device
Some software can be compromised in such a way as to potentially allow compromise of
the entire device. Consider the application's reputation in the industry with regard to such
weaknesses.

# Impact to network
While it's bad enough that a software compromise can lead to device compromise, it can
also lead to a compromise of multiple devices on the network.
