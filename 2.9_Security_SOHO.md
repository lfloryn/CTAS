# Configure security on SOHO wireless and wired networks.
### Index 

CompTIA wants administrators of SOHO networks to be able to secure those networks in
ways that protect the data stored on them. 

This objective looks at the security protection
that can be added to a wireless or wired SOHO network. 

First you'll look at issues specific
to a WLAN, and then you'll take a look at security considerations for wired and wireless
networks.

# Wireless_specific
Wireless networks present a unique set of challenges that wired networks do not. The communication
methods are somewhat different, as are the attack methods. In this section,
security issues that are relevant only to a WLAN are discussed.

## Changing default SSID
Every wireless AP or wireless router on the market comes with a default SSID. Cisco models
use the name tsunami, for example. You should change these defaults and create a new
SSID to represent your WLAN. Typically, when hackers see a default SSID, they make the
reasonable assumption that if the SSID was left at the default, the administrator password
was as well. So if you also failed to change that, hackers can now log in, take over your AP,
and lock you out.

## Setting encryption
The available types of wireless encryption (WEP, WPA, WPA2, and so on) were discussed
in [previosly  , and summarized earlier in this chapter.](2.3_Security_wireless.md) . 

Know that you should always enable
encryption for any SOHO network you administer and that you should choose the strongest
level of encryption you can work with. 

Keep in mind that WEP is no longer considered
secure and WPA is considered weak, so avoid their use if possible.

## Disabling SSID broadcast

One method of "protecting" the network that is often recommended is to turn off the SSID
broadcast. The AP is still there and can be accessed by those who know about it, but it prevents
those who are just scanning from finding it. This should be considered a weak form
of security because there are still other ways, albeit a bit more complicated, to discover the
presence of the AP besides the SSID broadcast.

## Antenna and access point placement
Antenna placement can be crucial in allowing clients to reach the AP. There isn't any one
universal solution to this issue, and it depends on the environment in which the AP is
placed. 

As a general rule, the greater the distance the signal must travel, the more it will
attenuate, but you can lose a signal quickly in a short space as well if the building materials
reflect or absorb the signal. 

You should try to avoid placing APs near metal (including
appliances) or near the ground. Placing them in the center of the area to be served, and high
enough to get around most obstacles, is recommended.

On the other end of the spectrum, you have to contend with the problem of the signal
traveling outside your intended network (known as signal leakage ) and being picked up in
public areas by outsiders. To lessen this problem, use RF-absorbent materials on external
walls, essentially shielding the surroundings.

## Radio power levels
On the chance that the signal is actually traveling too far, some APs include power-level
controls that allow you to reduce the amount of output provided.

![note](/img/note.jpg)
You can find a great source for information on RF power values and
antennas on the Cisco site at 
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless-mobility/wireless-lan-wlan/23231-powervalues-23231.html

## WPS
Wi-Fi protected setup (WPS) was a concept designed to make it easier for less knowledgeable
users to add a new client to the WLAN without manually entering the security information
on the client. 

One method involves pushing a button on the AP at the same time
a client is attempting to join the network so that the settings are sent to the client. Other
methods involve placing the client close to the AP, and near-fi eld communication is used for
the process.

Regardless of the details, as often happens when we try to make security simpler, we
make it fail. It has been discovered that a hacker can identify the PIN used in a short period
of time, and with it the network's WPA/WPA2 preshared key. 

For this reason, the Wi-Fi
Alliance has recommended against using this feature.

# Change_default_usernames_and_passwords

Default accounts include not only those created with the installation of the operating systems
but often also accounts associated with hardware. Wireless APs, routers, and similar
devices often include accounts for interacting with, and administering, those devices.

You
should always change the passwords associated with those devices and, where possible,
change the usernames.

If there are accounts that are not needed, disable them or delete them. Make certain
you use strong password policies and protect the passwords with the same security you do
for any users or administrators (in other words, don't write the router's password on an
address label and stick it to the bottom of the router).

In Windows, the Guest account is automatically created with the intent that it is to be
used when someone must access a system but lacks a user account on that system.

Because
it is so widely known to exist, I recommend that you not use this default account and
instead create another one for the same purpose if you truly need one. 

The Guest account
leaves a security risk at the workstation and should be disabled to prevent it from being
accessed by those attempting to gain unauthorized access.

Change every username and password that you can so they vary from their
default settings.

# Enable_MAC_filtering


The earlier section ["MAC address filtering,"](2.2_Security_logical_security.md#Port_security) , explained the importance
of enabling MAC filtering, which is turned off by default.

![tip](/img/tip.jpg)
Adding port authentication to MAC filtering takes security for the network
down to the switch port level and increases your security exponentially.

# Assign_static_IP_addresses

While DHCP can be a godsend, a SOHO network is small enough that you can get by
without it issuing IP addresses to each host. 

The advantage to assigning the IP addresses
statically is that you can make certain which host is associated with which IP address and
then utilize filtering to limit network access to only those hosts.

While static IP addressing may not be scalable in a wired network with many devices, in
a small network, using static IP addressing will make it impossible for someone to just plug
into your network without knowing your IP address scheme.

# Firewall_settings
All devices both wired and wireless should have personal fi rewalls enabled and confi gured
to protect each system. In Windows, you can simply leverage the personal firewall that
comes on all Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, and 10 computers.

For operating systems that don't
come with a personal fi rewall, third-party software should be implemented for this purpose.
These fi rewalls help to prevent other devices from connecting to each station without
the approval of the users.

The presence of personal firewalls on all the devices does not mean you don't need a
network firewall at the edge of the network and between sections of the network that may
have varying security levels.

You can find more information on firewalls under several
objectives throughout this [chapter](2.2_Security_logical_security.md#Firewalls) .

# Port_forwarding/mapping

Another option to harden the entrance to the network is to deploy port forwarding or mapping.
Port forwarding is a function typically performed on the same device that may be performing
network address translation (NAT). 

One port number is set aside on the gateway
for the exclusive use of communicating with a service in the private network, located on a
specifi c host. External hosts must know this port number and the address of the gateway to
communicate with the network-internal service. The purpose of this is to hide the real IP
address of the destination device or server to protect it from connections outside the LAN.

# Disabling_ports
Disable all unneeded protocols/ports. If you don't need them, remove them or prevent them
from loading. Ports not in use present an open door for an attacker to enter.

![tip](/img/tip.jpg)
Many of the newer SOHO router solutions (and some of the personal firewall
solutions on end-user workstations) close down the ICMP ports by
default. Keep this in mind; it can drive you nuts when you are trying to see
whether a new station, server, or router is up and running by using the
ping command. This command depends on the use of ICMP.

# Content_filtering/parental_controls

Content filtering software examines all web connections, and in some cases emails, for
objectionable content or sites that have been identifi ed as off-limits by the administrator.
While this can be helpful in preventing the introduction of malware or in screening objectionable
content, you should be aware that these filters are making educated guesses about
what to deny and allow.

A filter will invariably deny content that should be allowed and allow content that
should be denied. Try to be as specific as possible when defining keywords that are used
to identify sites and content and set the expectation among users that the software is not
perfect.

Parental controls operate on the same basic premise.

# Update_Firmware
In the past, updating firmware on devices such as APs, routers, and switches was considered
to be desirable but optional. 

More and more security attacks are based on attacking
the firmware, and for this reason firmware updates should be part of whatever automated
update system you may be using (not to mention the additional functionality and bug elimination
you may experience). 

It may be that you can get on a mailing list for each vendor
so you can be notifi ed when firmware updates are available.

In any case, some systematic
method must be developed to ensure these updates are maintained.

# Physical_security
Just as you would not park your car in a public garage and leave its doors wide open with
the key in the ignition, you should educate users not to leave a workstation that they are
logged into when they attend meetings, go to lunch, and so forth. They should log out of
the workstation or lock it.

"Lock when you leave" should be a mantra they become familiar
with. Locking the workstation should require a password (usually the same as their user
password) to resume working at the workstation.

Moreover, don't overlook the obvious need for physical security. Adding a cable to lock
a laptop to a desk prevents someone from picking it up and walking away with a copy of
your customer database. 

Laptop cases generally include a built-in security slot in which a
cable lock can be added to prevent it from being carried away easily, like the one shown in
Figure

**A cable in the security slot keeps the laptop from being carried away easily.**

![soho](/img/f2.7_Sec_SOHO_s1.jpg)


When it comes to desktop models, adding a lock to the back cover can prevent an
intruder with physical access from grabbing the hard drive or damaging the internal components.
You should also physically secure network devices—routers, APs, and the like.
Place them in locked cabinets, if possible. 

If they are not physically secured, the opportunity
exists for them to be stolen or manipulated in such a way to allow someone unauthorized
to connect to the network.
