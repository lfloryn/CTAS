# Establish networking connections

When configuring the connection method for accessing the Internet, the three choices
Windows offers are This Computer Connects Directly To The Internet, This Computer
Connects Through A Residential Gateway Or Another Computer, and Other. If you choose
the first option, you can turn on Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) and allow this machine
to serve as a proxy. 

The network connection you configure can be wireless or wired, dialup,
or a virtual private network (VPN).

**VPN** A VPN is used when you want to connect from a remote location (such as home) to
the company's network (authenticating the user and encrypting the data).

**Dial-ups**Dial-up connections are used when a modem must be used to gain access.

Typically, the dial-up connection is to an Internet service provider (ISP) and used in remote
locations where faster forms of access are not available.

**Wireless A** wireless connection uses one of the 802.11 technologies, along with encryption
to connect to the network.

**Wired A** wired connection uses a wire to connect the computer to the network. Typically,
this is an Ethernet cable, such as 100BaseT, which connects to a hub or switch and offers
network access to the host.

**WWAN (Cellular)** A wireless wide area network (WWAN) connection is one that uses
cellular to connect the host to the network. A wireless service provider (such as AT&T,
Sprint, or T-Mobile) will provide a card that is plugged into the host to make the cellular
connection possible.

The choices will vary slightly based on the version of Windows you are using, but those
commonly available are shown in Table
