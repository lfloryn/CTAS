# Configuring an alternative IP address in Windows

Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10 all allow the use of an alternate IP address. This is an address
that is configured for the system to use in the event the first choice is not available. The first
choice can be either a dynamic or static address, and the alternate is used only if the primary
cannot be found or used, such as when the DHCP server is down.

The Properties dialog box for each instance of IPv4—on any of the Windows operating
systems this exam focuses on—contains an Alternate Configuration tab. To make changes,
you must click it.

A scenario for using this is when your corporate network uses a DHCP server while you
use a static address at home. You can set for DHCP and then make the alternate address
the static address required at home.

# IP Addressing
Two radio buttons appear on the Alternate Configuration tab, as shown in Figure
Automatic Private IP Address and User Configured. 

The default is the first, meaning
that the alternate address used is one in the APIPA range (169.254.x.x). Selecting User
Configured requires you to enter a static IP address to be used in the IP address field. The
entry entered must be valid for your network for it to be usable.

# Subnet Mask
When you select the User Configured radio button on the Alternate Configuration tab, you
must enter a value in the Subnet Mask field. This value must correspond with the subnet
values in use on your network and work with the IP address you enter in the field above
(see Chapter 2, "Networking" for more information on subnet addresses).

# DNS
When you select the User Configured radio button on the Alternate Configuration tab, you
should also enter values in the fields Preferred DNS Server and Alternate DNS Server. These
entries are needed in order to translate domain names into IP addresses (see Chapter 2 for
more information on DNS).

# Gateway
When you select the User Configured radio button on the Alternate Configuration tab, you must
enter a value in the Default Gateway field. This value must correspond with the subnet values and
the IP address you enter in the fields above. This address identifies the router to be used to communicate
outside the local network (see Chapter 2 for more information on default gateways).
