# Printer sharing vs. network printer mapping
In  "Hardware"  section "Public/shared devices," you learned how to share
a printer that is connected locally to a computer. It is also possible to connect to a network
printer that is not tied to a computer but has its own IP address and probably built-in print
server. 

To connect or map a user's device to one of these devices, follow the procedure
to add a shared printer, and on the page you normally enter the UNC path to the shared
printer, select the option Add A Printer Using A TCP/IP Address Or Hostname, as shown
in next Figure, and click Next.

Enter the IP address or the hostname of the printer, as shown in Figure, and click
Next.

If the IP address is correct and can be reached, the printer driver will download, and the
printer will be added to the printer's area of Control Panel.
