# Domain setup

In a domain (also known as a client-server network), users log on to the server by supplying
a username and password. They're then authenticated for the duration of their session.

Rather than requiring users to give a password for every resource they want to access
(which would be share-level), security is based on how they authenticated themselves at the
beginning of their session. This is known as user-level security, and it's much more powerful
than share-level security.

Enterprise networks join servers, workstations, and other devices into security associations
called domains or realms. These associations are made possible through the use of
directory services such as Active Directory. These associations are what make the concept
of single sign-on possible. This means that any user can log into the network using any
device that is a domain member and receive all his assigned rights and privileges by using a
single logon.

Joining a computer to the domain can be done during the installation in some cases, but
most administrators do this after the successful installation of the operating system. 

An
example of how this is done in Windows 10 is shown in Figure. This is done on the
Computer Name tab of System Properties by clicking the Change button. To navigate to
System Properties, open Control Panel and select the System icon (using icon view). Then
select Advanced System Settings from the menu on the left side of the page. This opens the
System Properties dialog box shown in Figure .
