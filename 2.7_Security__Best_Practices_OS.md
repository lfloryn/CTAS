# Implement security best practices to secure a workstation.
### Index 

In the previous objectives, the importance of user education has been mentioned. The user
represents the weakest link in the security chain, whether the harm comes to them in the
form of malware, social engineering, or simply avoidable mistakes. The workstation represents
the digital arm of the user and must be properly and adequately secured to keep the
user—and the network—protected.

A number of best practices are involved with securing a workstation. While a checklist
could take many pages, depending on your environment, CompTIA has identified five that
should appear on any roster. The following are the subobjectives covered in this section:

- Password best practices
- Account management
- Disable autorun
- Data encryption
- Patch/update management

# Password best practices

One of the strongest ways to keep a system safe is to employ strong passwords and educate
your users in the best security practices. In this section, you'll explore various techniques
that can enhance the security of your user passwords.

# Setting Strong Passwords

Passwords should be as long as possible. Most security experts believe a password of 10
characters is the minimum that should be used if security is a real concern. If you use only
the lowercase letters of the alphabet, you have 26 characters with which to work. If you
add the numeric values 0 through 9, you'll get another 10 characters. If you go one step further
and add the uppercase letters, you'll then have an additional 26 characters, giving you
a total of 62 characters with which to construct a password.

![tip](/img/tip.jpg)
Most vendors recommend that you use nonalphabetical characters such as
#, $, and % in your password, and some go so far as to require it.

If you used a 4-character password, this would be 62 × 62 × 62 × 62, or approximately
14 million password possibilities. 

If you used 5 characters in your password, this would
give you 62 to the fi fth power, or approximately 920 million password possibilities. If you
used a 10-character password, this would give you 62 to the tenth power, or 8.4 × 10 17 (a
very big number) possibilities. 

As you can see, these numbers increase exponentially with
each character added to the password. The 4-digit password could probably be broken in a
fraction of a day, whereas the 10-digit password would take considerably longer and consume
much more processing power.

If your password used only the 26 lowercase letters from the alphabet, the 4-digit
password would have 26 to the fourth power, or 456,000 password combinations. 

A 5-character password would have 26 to the fifth power, or more than 11 million, and a
10-character password would have 26 to the tenth power, or 1.4 × 10 14 . 

This is still a big
number, but it would take considerably less time to break it. As noted earlier, NIST now
considers password length more important than complexity.

# Password expiration
The longer that a password is used, the more likely it is that it will be compromised in some
way. It is for this reason that requiring users to change their passwords at certain intervals
increases the security of their passwords. 

You should require users to set a new password
every 30 days (more frequently for higher-security networks), and you must also prevent
them from reusing old passwords. 

Most password management systems have the ability to
track previously used passwords and to disallow users from recycling old passwords.



# Screensaver required password
A screensaver should automatically start after a short period of idle time, and that screensaver
should require a password before the user can begin the session again. This method of
locking the workstation adds one more level of security.

# BIOS/UEFI passwords
Passwords should be confi gured and required to access either the BIOS or UEFI settings on
all devices. If this is not the case, it would be possible for someone to reboot a device, enter
the settings, change the boot order, boot to an operating system residing on a USB or optical
drive, and use that OS as a platform to access data located on the other drives. While
this is a worst-case scenario, there is also less signifi cant mayhem a malicious person could
cause in the BIOS and UEFI.

# Requiring passwords
Make absolutely certain you require passwords (such a simple thing to overlook in a small
network) for all accounts, and change the default passwords on system accounts.

# Account management
While I touched on one account management technique previously (preventing the reuse of
passwords), there are a number of additional account management best practices that you
should know and implement.

# Restricting user permissions
When assigning user permissions, follow the principle of least privilege (discussed earlier)
by giving users only the bare minimum they need to do their job. Assign permissions to
groups, rather than users, and make users members of groups (or remove them from them)
as they change roles or positions.

# Logon time restrictions
Most users have a set work schedule, and it is only during these works hours that the user
should access the network and its resources. Since an active account is an account vulnerable
to misuse, any time in which you can disable an account while still allowing users to do their
jobs enhances security, since a disabled account cannot be used for malicious purposes.

For this reason, many administrators allow users to log in only during certain hours.

Typically, access is allowed from about an hour before their workday until about an hour
after the day ends (to allow some flexibility). For certain users who tend to work throughout
the day and night, this system may not work.

# Disabling guest account
To secure the system, disable all accounts that are not needed (especially the guest account).
Next, rename the accounts if you can (Microsoft won't allow you to rename an account to
Administrator). Finally, change the passwords from the defaults and add them to the cycle
of passwords that routinely get changed.

# Failed attempts lockout
Earlier you learned that a brute-force attack is a password attack that attempts all character
combinations until the password is discovered. You also learned that the attacks are
typically performed offline and not in a live environment. 

Why is that? It's because almost
all password systems are set up to allow only a set number of failed password attempts
before the account is locked. While this policy may generate more password reset calls
than you would like, that effect can be mitigated by implementing a complementary policy
that allows the account to be automatically reenabled after a set amount of time (say five
minutes). 

When this policy is communicated to the users, they know just to wait for five
minutes and try again.

# Timeout/screen lock
While the relative sensitivity of the data appearing on the screen of a user's computer can
vary from time to time and from user to user, it is a good practice to protect that information
when someone steps away from the device. 

Moreover, when the device is in an outof-
the-way location, it may even afford someone the chance to browse the device. For this
reason, you should require on all devices a password-protected screensaver that kicks in
after a short period of inactivity.

# Change default admin user account/password
All Windows devices and all infrastructure devices such as routers, firewalls, switches, and
wireless access points and controllers come with default administrator accounts and default
passwords. 

The names of these accounts and the default passwords are well known to malicious
individuals. They can be looked up in five minutes on the Internet. Always change
the default names and passwords for these accounts; otherwise, you may find someone else
"owning" the device at some point in time.

# Basic Active Directory functions
As an A+ technician you are not expected to be an expert in Active Directory, but you are
expected to be able to perform basic account management in AD. Let's go over the basic
account operations.

## Account creation
To create a new account in Active Directory Users And Computers, use the following
steps: 

```dos
1. Open Active Directory Users And Computers MMC.
2. Right-click the organizational unit where you would like the accounts to be located. Select New and then User from the context menu that appears.
3. Fill out the fields in the New Object – User window, including first name, last name, and logon name (the minimum). Then select Next.
4. Fill in the password and confirm it. As shown in Figure , select "User must change password at next logon" and select Next.
5. This completes the creation of the new account.
```

## Account deletion

To delete an account, follow these steps:

```dos
1. Open Active Directory Users And Computers MMC.
2. Right-click the organizational unit where the account is located.
3. Right-click the account. Select Delete. Answer Yes to the dialog box confirming your section. The account is deleted.
```

![note](/img/note.jpg)
Make sure first! Prior to deleting an account, you should first disable it for a period and make sure that there
is no resource (such as an encrypted file) that can be reached only through the account.

## Password reset/unlock account

To reset a password, follow these steps:


```dos
1. Open the Active Directory Users And Computers MMC.
2. Right-click the organizational unit where the account is located.
3. Right-click the account. Select Change Password. Enter the new password. Answer Yes to the dialog box confirming your section. The password is changed.
```

## To unlock an account, follow these steps:

```dos
1. Open Active Directory Users And Computers MMC.
2. Right-click the organizational unit where the account is located.
3. Right-click the account. Clear the Account Is Disabled option. Answer Yes to the dialog box confirming your section. The account is enabled.
```

## Disable account

To disable an account, follow these steps:


```dos
1. Open Active Directory Users And Computers MMC.
2. Right-click the organizational unit where the account is located.
3. Right-click the account. Select Disable. Answer Yes to the dialog box confirming your section. The account is disabled.
```

# Disable autorun
It is never a good idea to put any media in a workstation if you do not know where it came
from or what it is. The reason is that the media (CD, DVD, USB) could contain malware.

Compounding matters, that malware could be referenced in the Autorun.inf file, causing it
to be summoned when the media is inserted in the machine and requiring no other action.

Autorun.inf can be used to start an executable, access a website, or do any of a large number
of different tasks. The best way to prevent a user from falling victim to such a ploy is to
disable the AutoRun feature on the workstation.

Microsoft has changed (by default, disabled) the AutoRun function on Windows Vista,
Windows 7, Windows 8, and Widows 10, though running remains the default action for PCs
using Windows XP through Service Pack 3. 

The reason Microsoft changed the default action
can be summed up in a single word: security. That text-based Autorun.inf file not only can
take your browser to a web page but also can call any executable file, pass along variable
information about the user, or do just about anything else imaginable. 

Simply put, it is never
a good idea to take any media whose source or contents you have no idea of and plug it into
your system. Such an action opens up the user—and their network—to any number of possible
tribulations. 

An entire business's data could be jeopardized by such a minuscule act if a
harmful CD were placed in a computer at work by someone with elevated privileges.

# Data encryption

While data encryption is possible both on a drive level (BitLocker) and on an individual
file level (EFS), always keep in mind the cost of encryption and save this tool for instances
where you really need it. 

By cost I mean that any encrypted file must be decrypted to be
opened and encrypted again to be saved. This requires CPU cycles on the device. 

If you
attempt to encrypt everything, the performance of the device may make it practically unusable.
You must strike a balance between security and usability.

# Patch/update management
While many patches and updates either repair something that doesn't work or add functionality,
many others close a security hole. These are called hotfixes because they come out
as soon as they are available, and you need to apply them as soon as possible (after testing
them in a nonproduction environment).

For best results in patch management, you should deploy an automated system that can
check for, download, and make available to the network all patches and updates for all
systems. A good example of such a system is Microsoft Windows Server Update Services
(WSUS), which can manage the updates for both servers and clients and for other operating
systems as well.

![warning](/img/warning.jpg)
All patches should be deployed in a test environment prior to live deployment.
This ensures that systems will not be adversely affected by an
update that has issues.
