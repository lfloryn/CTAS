# Troubleshoot Microsoft Windows OS problems.
### Index 

Because it's software and there are so many places where things can go wrong, the operating
system can be one of the most confusing components to troubleshoot. Sometimes it
seems a miracle that operating systems even work at all, considering the hundreds of files
that work together to make the system function. In this section, common operating system
issues and their solutions are covered.

## Common symptoms
What follows in this section can seem like a daunting list of symptoms the operating system
can exhibit. 

But with a proper plan of action and good backup (always have a backup!), you
can approach any of these problems with confidence. In many cases today, technicians have
ceased to spend significant amounts of time chasing operating system issues, since the most
important data is kept on servers, and computers can be reimaged so quickly that troubleshooting
doesn't warrant the effort. 

Nevertheless, you should know these basic symptoms and the approach to take when they present themselves.

# Slow_performance

Slow system performance can come from many issues. For the purposes of this discussion,
I will focus on performance that deteriorates after being acceptable, as opposed to system
performance that is poor from the outset (which could be a matter of insufficient resources
such as RAM). Here is a list of possibilities:

- The first thing to check is the presence of a virus. If the system seems to have an overabundance
of disk activity, scan it for viruses using a virus program that resides externally
on a CD/DVD or memory stick.
- Defragment the hard drive. The more fragmented it is, the slower the disk access will be.
- Check the space on the hard drive. When the partition or volume where the operating
system is located becomes full, performance will suffer. This is why it is a good idea to
store data and applications on a different partition from that holding the system files.
- Ensure that the latest updates are installed. In many cases, updates help to solve performance
problems, so make sure they are current.
- Use Task Manager to determine whether a process is using too much memory or CPU
or is simply locked up (not responding), and if necessary, end the process.

# Limited_connectivity

In some cases, the computer has connectivity to some but not all resources. When this is the
case, issues that may reside on other layers of the OSI model should come under consideration.
These include the following:

Authentication Issues Does the user have permission to access the resource?
DNS Issues You may be able to ping the entire network using IP addresses, but most
access is done by name, not IP address. 

If you can't ping resources by name, DNS is not
functional, meaning that either the DNS server is down or the local machine is not configured
with the correct IP address of the DNS server. 

If recent changes have occurred in the
DNS mappings or if your connection to the destination device has recently failed because of
a temporary network issue that has been solved, you may need to clear the local DNS cache
using the ipconfig/flushdns command.

Remote Problem Don't forget that establishing a connection is a two-way street, and if
the remote device has an issue, communication cannot occur. 

Always check the remote
device as well. Any interconnecting device between the computer and resource, such as a
switch or router, should also be checked for functionality.

# Failure_to_boot

Booting problems can occur with corruption of the boot files or missing components.
Common error messages include an invalid boot disk, inaccessible boot drive, missing
NTLDR file, or missing BOOTMGR (some of which are discussed in more detail later in
this section). 

Fortunately, during the installation of the operating system, log files are created
in the **%SystemRoot%** and **%SystemRoot%\Debug**folders (C:\WINNT for older systems and
C:\Windows for Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10). 

If you have a puzzling problem,
look at these logs and see whether you can find error entries there. With Windows 7, for
example, the following are some of the log files created:

**netsetup.log** This file differs from all the others in that it's in the Debug folder and not
just %SystemRoot%. Entries in it detail the workgroup and domain options given during
installation.

**setupact.log** Known as the action log, this file is a chronological list of what took
place during the setup. There is a tremendous amount of information here; of key importance
is whether any errors occurred. 

The last lines of the file can show which operation
was transpiring when the installation failed or whether the installation ended with errors.
Like all the log files created during setup, this file is in ASCII text format and can be viewed
with any viewer (WordPad, Word, and so on).

**setuperr.log** The error log, as this file is commonly called, is written to at the time
errors are noted in other log files. For example, an entry in setuperr.log may show that
an error occurred, and you can find additional information about it in setuperr.log. Not
only are the errors here, but the severity of each is also given.

You can configure problems with system failure to write dump files (debugging information)
for later analysis when they occur by clicking **Start ➢ Control Panel ➢ System**
and then clicking the**Advanced System Settings option**. The Advanced tab of the System
Properties dialog box should open. 

Then click the **Settings**button in the **Startup and
Recovery** section. Here, in addition to choosing the default operating system, you can configure
whether events should be written to the system log, whether an alert should be sent
to the administrator, and what type of memory dump should be written.

# No_OS_found
The "no operating system found" message can result from a number of issues. Among them
are the following:

- Nonsystem disk in the floppy drive
- Incorrect boot device order in the BIOS
- Corrupted or missing boot sector
- Corrupted boot files

In short, the operating system is not actually missing; the system is missing the file that
can either locate it or load it. 

Follow the steps in this section with respect to the ntldr and boot.ini files.

In Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10 if using Startup Repair does not work, you
may need to create a bootable disc to boot the device. The directions for this vary between
the systems but can be found on the Microsoft site. Then you have two approaches.

**For Windows 8, one approach is to follow these steps:**


```dos
1. Insert the installation DVD or USB and boot Windows 8 from it.
2. On the Windows Setup page, select the language to install, the time and currency format, and the keyboard or input method; then click Next.
3. Click Repair Your Computer and select Troubleshoot.
4. Click Advanced Options, select Automatic Repair, and select the operating system.

```

The other approach is to try to rebuild the boot configuration data, booting from the

**Windows 8 installation media and following these instructions:**

```dos
1. Insert the installation DVD or USB and boot Windows 8 from it.
2. On the Windows Setup page, select the language to install, the time and currency format, and the keyboard or input method; then click Next.
3. Click Repair Your Computer and select Troubleshoot.
4. Click Advanced Options, click the command prompt, type the following commands, and press Enter after each command:

Bootrec /fixmbr
Bootrec /fixboot
Bootrec /rebuildbcd

5. Restart the computer. Check whether you're able to boot now.
```

# Application_crashes

Another possible symptom of a malware infection is the crashing of applications. While
this will occur from time to time for other reasons, when it is occurring repeatedly, you
should suspect malware. 

When the application that is crashing is your antivirus software,
this is an even stronger indication of malware because disabling or damaging your antivirus
protection is the first thing that some types of malware attempt to do.

[Top](#Index)

# Blue_screens
Once a regular occurrence when working with Windows, blue screens (**also known as the blue
screen of death, or BSOD**) have become less common. 

Occasionally, systems will lock up; you
can usually examine the log files to discover what was happening when this occurred and take
steps to correct it. Remember, when dealing with a blue screen, always ask yourself, "What did
I just install or change?" In many cases, the change is involved in the BSOD. 

Also keep in mind
that (as the instructions on the blue screen will tell you) a simple reboot will often fix the problem.
Retaining the contents of the BSOD can help troubleshoot the issue. In most instances,
you can find the BSOD error in Microsoft's knowledge base to help with troubleshooting.

The Apple pinwheel is displayed automatically by WindowServer when an application
cannot handle all the events it receives. (WindowServer is the background process that runs
the mac OS X graphical user interface.) 

To find out whether the CPU is a bottleneck on performance,
use Activity Monitor (/Applications/Utilities) to monitor CPU usage. The
pinwheel or beach ball may also appear if you don't have enough RAM.
Software can also cause the pinwheel. 

Open Activity Monitor's CPU tab and sort by the
% CPU column in descending order; the apps at the top are the ones using the most CPU
cycles. 

If an application is frozen, it will appear in red. If it is not a process with root listed
as the user, quit it.

[Top](#Index)

# Black_screens
While a black screen may indicate a loss of connectivity to the display or loss of power to
the display, when you rule that out, it can be a deeper issue. 

It could indicate that the basic
input/output system (BIOS), which is the firmware on the motherboard that has the lowlevel
instructions required by the board to load the OS, is corrupted. This means you won't
even get the Dell or HP screen you normally see during bootup.

If you see it after seeing the firmware screen, then the system is having an issue locating the
boot files. It could also be that the hard drive is dead, which means the files cannot be accessed.

# Printing_issues

Outside of the printer problems you learned about in "Hardware and Network Troubleshooting," printers should just print from the aspect of the operating system.
Unfortunately, printing issues at the software level are very common and sometimes difficult
to fix. 

Again, collecting the information to identify the problem is the first step to solving
the problem with printing in the operating system.

The first step is to check the most obvious stuff, such as:

- Is the printer on?
- Is anything unplugged?

Are there errors on the printer?

- Toner out
- Paper out
- Offline
- Does the operating system see the printer?

Assuming the problem isn't something as simple as being out of paper, the next step is to
send a test page with the Printers & Scanners settings app, as shown in Figure. You
can view the status of the printers installed on the operating system. To print a test page,
select the printer and choose Manage.

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_1.jpg)

If the test page prints, then the problem might be the application printing to the printer.
A common problem with applications (such as Word) is that they expect a specific paper
size when printing a document, and the document might be misconfigured for the wrong
paper size.

If a simple test fails, such as sending a test page, then the driver might need to be
upgraded or reinstalled. Record the information about the printer, such as model and
accessories, and visit the vendor's website to download the latest driver. 

You should also
check to see if newer firmware exists for the printer. If so, follow the vendor's directions for
installation.

The Print Management MMC is a second way to manage printers. It provides detailed
information, such as the printer driver version, as shown in Figure. To open the Print
Management MMC, click the Start menu, type Administrative Tools, and then select Print
Management from the results. The Print Management MMC allows you to manage printers
on the local computer as well as remote servers. You can perform all the same functionality
in the MMC as you would in the Settings app.

# Services_fail_to_start

Sometimes when the system is started, you receive a message that tells you a service failed
to start. When that occurs, use the event log to determine the service that failed. 

Then,
to interact with the service, access the Administrative Tools section of Control Panel and
choose Services. This starts the Services console. You can right-click any service and choose
to start, stop, pause, resume, or restart it. 

You can also double-click the service to access its
properties and configure such things as the startup type, dependencies, and other variables.
If the service refuses to start, it could be that a service on which it depends will not start.

To determine what services must be running for the problem service to start, select the
Dependencies tab of the service's Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure

Service dependencies

![notes](/img/note.jpg)

    Did You Reboot Your Computer?
    
    Quick quiz: You just got an error in Windows, and it appears that you are on the verge of a
    crash (of your application or the whole system). What do you do? The first thing is to write down any error messages that appear. Then save your work (if possible) and reboot your computer.
    
    Anyone who has called tech support, or who has been a tech support person, knows how demeaning the question, "Did you restart your computer?" can seem. Most people respond with an indignant, "Of course!" In reality, they might or might not have actually done it.
    
    Whenever there's a software problem, always, always reboot the computer before trying to troubleshoot. Often, the problem will disappear, and you'll have just saved yourself half an hour of frustration. If the same problem reappears, then you know that you have work to do.
    
    Why does rebooting help? When an application is running, it creates one or more temporary files that it uses to store information. It also stores information in memory (RAM). If a temporary file or information in RAM becomes corrupted (such as by application A writing
    its information into application B's memory space), the original application can have problems. Rebooting will clear the memory registers and most often remove problematic temporary files, thus eliminating the issue.
    
    It might sound trite, but the first axiom in troubleshooting software really is to reboot.
    
    Even if the user says they did, ask them to reboot again. (Tell them you want to see the opening screen for any possible error messages, or make up another good excuse.) If the problem doesn't come back, it's not a problem. If it does, then you can use your software
    skills to fix it.

# Slow_bootup

Slow bootups can be caused by a number of issues. First, it could be that the system is
struggling for resources. This might indicate a memory or hard drive issue. It also can slow
down the startup if many programs are set to start at bootup.

In cases where the computer belongs to a domain, it could also be having trouble locating
the domain controller and perhaps performing policy updates.

Finally, it could be that the device is set to access a **Distributed File System (DFS)** share
or other type of remote drive and locating it is the issue. (DFS is a system used to provide
connections to shared folders without known their physical location.) The cause could also
be the next issue in the list.

Performance problems at bootup can be identified with methods detailed earlier in this
chapter. By enabling boot logging and examining the **ntbtlog.txt** file, you can identify
what is slowing down bootup performance.

You can also use the **System Configuration (msconfig.exe)** utility to identify slow
bootup problems. By selecting the Selective Startup option in the System Configuration utility,
you can choose not to start system services and load startup items; only critical services
will load, as shown in Figure

Selective Startup selection

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_4.jpg)

After choosing Selective Startup and applying it, you
can switch to the Services tab to see the services that won't be started on the next reboot,
as shown in Figure

Selective Services

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_5.jpg)

Using the process of elimination, you can add services back and reboot to time performance
of bootup, which will allow you to identify the bootup slowdown. Usually Microsoft services
will not slow down the boot process. Third-party services—usually antivirus or anti-malware
software—will most likely be the culprits.

[Top](#Index)

# Slow-Loading_Profiles
A local profile is a group of settings for the user as well as their personal files. Local profiles
can be slow to load because of items set to start, when the profile is loaded. You can use
Task Manager to selectively disable startup items, as shown in Figure 24.24. By the process
of elimination and after several logouts and logins, you can narrow down the performance
problem caused by slow-loading local profiles.

**Startup items in Task Manager**

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_6.jpg)

Typically discuss slow-loading profiles in respect to network-based roaming profiles,
not local profiles. The fundamental difference is that local profiles don't need to traverse a
network during login. 

Roaming profiles, on the other hand, need to traverse the network
during login (load from the server) and logout (write back to the server).

There are some things you can do to alleviate the stress on the network and speed up
the load time of network profiles. 

For example, you can save space by deleting temporary
Internet files in both Edge and Internet Explorer. You can also save a tremendous amount
of space—sometimes gigabytes—by deleting downloaded files.

# Common_solutions
The following are some common approaches to addressing the issues described in the previous
section.

[Top](#Index)

# Defragment_the_hard_drive

Defragmentation tools are used to reorganize the physical location of the data on the hard
drive so as to locate all pieces of a file together in the same place. When this is done, it
improves the performance of the drive. All operating systems come with built-in defragmentation
tools, and their operation can be scheduled for a time convenient to the user.

This also frees the user (and the technician) from having to think about running the tool
on a regular basis. Figure 8.2 shows the Drive Optimization tool in Windows 8.1. 

To arrive at this tool, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap Search (or if you're using
a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and
click Search), enter Defragment in the search box, tap or click Defragment, and optimize
your drives.

**The Drive Optimization tool**

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_7.jpg)

![note](/img/note.jpg)
Disk Cleanup is a utility that can be used to free up space on the operating system, by deleting temporary files, thumbnails, and
temporary Internet files, just to name a few. You can access Disk Utility by clicking the Start menu, typing Disk Cleanup , and then
selecting it from the results. You can also right-click a root drive, like the C: drive, under This PC, choose Properties, and then click
Disk Cleanup on the General tab.

# Reboot
Rebooting a system often takes care of problems, for a multitude of reasons. One of the top
reasons is that it allows the operating system to terminate hung processes gracefully. After
the operating system reboots, the processes are normally restarted. 

An added bonus is that
only the applications the user requires are re-launched. The goal is to fi x the user's problem
with minimal disruption. A reboot can't be done every time, especially if the user could lose
work as a result.

Depending on the circumstance, when reproducing a problem, one of the fi rst things
to do is reboot. It serves an important purpose of isolating the problem so that you can
reproduce it. For example, if you've isolated the problem to Excel not scrolling properly
when a web browser is open, you should reboot and try to replicate the problem. If you
discover the reboot fi xed the problem, then you've solved the problem. 

However, if the
problem still exists, you've now isolated the problem further by eliminating other programs
that could have been hung in the background affecting this problem. The steps
of rebooting and then opening Excel can also be used to verify when you've solved the
problem.

[Top](#Index)

# Kill_tasks
Depending on the situation, sometimes a process must be terminated because it is frozen
and non-responsive. 

Terminating a process should be considered a last resort because the
potential for loss of work is high, especially if it's a Microsoft Offi ce application. Killing
the process of Excel with a spreadsheet that hasn't been saved will certainly lose work.

However, if Excel is non-responsive, then it is also causing a work stoppage and is equally
disruptive. As a technician, you must evaluate when loss of work due to force closing the
application with unsaved work is necessary. It's a tough position to be in, but over your
career you will fi nd yourself in that very position.

You can kill processes in the GUI through either Task Manager or Resource Manager.
In Task Manager, simply right-click the process and select End Task, as shown in
Figure . 

**Killing a non-responsive process**

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_8.jpg)


In Resource Manager, you can use the same process to kill a process. In [Killing 
Exercise](/exercise/3.1_stop_process.pdf) you'll get some practice killing processes through the GUI.

[Top](#Index)


# Restart_services
In some cases, it may not be necessary to kill the service. It may be advisable to simply
restart the service. See the earlier section "Services fail to start."

Manually starting a service

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_11.jpg)

Services can be configured to automatically start in the event of failure on the Recovery
tab of the Services properties, as shown in Figure . 

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_12.jpg)

For example, by default the Print
Spooler service is set to restart on the first and second failure, but after that it will remain
stopped. The reset counter can be set for a number of days, and the service can be started
after a specific number of minutes after its failure. You can even have the computer restart
or run a program in the event a service fails.

# Update_network_settings
In many cases a simple update of the network settings can solve a connectivity issue.
In most scenarios, devices are making use of a DHCP server; so, simply executing
the **ipconfig /release** and **ipconfig /renew** commands will cause an update of the
settings. 

If you find after this that the device has an address in the 169.254.0.1 through
169.254.255.254 range, the client is not finding the DHCP server. It could be that the
server is not on the same segment as the device or that it is down or out of IP addresses.

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_13.jpg)

You can manually change settings in the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)
Properties for the network card, as shown in Figure . 

You can access these settings
by right-clicking the Start menu, then Network Connections, then Network
and Sharing Center, then Change adapter settings, finally right-click the adapter
and select Properties. To update the gateway and DNS settings, click Advanced (see
Figure)

IPv4 Properties

# Reimage/reload_OS
In some cases, especially in the case of a serious malware infection, it is simpler to just
reimage the device and start over with a clean installation. For this reason, always encourage
users to not save data on the local hard drive, as this will complicate the issue. If they
insist, at least convince them to perform their own data backups.

If your organization does not use a standardized image for its computers, you can use
the Windows Recovery Environment and select the Reset This PC option. If the computers
have a preinstalled image, you can use the System Image Recovery option to reload the
operating system. 

You can select this option by holding down the Shift key as you reboot
the operating system, then choose Advanced Options after the reboot, then System Image
Recovery. 

You can also reset the computer by opening the Settings app, then Update &
Security, then Recovery, then Reset This PC (Get started), and finally choose Remove
Everything. Depending on the type of computer you have, it may have a proprietary process
for recovering system images.

# Roll_back_updates
Vendors test updates before rolling them out, but it is impossible for them to anticipate
every scenario in which the update may be introduced. For this reason, an update might
break something. In that case, the issues should occur soon after the update. It's always
worth the attempt to roll back the update, as it is simple to do. Just locate the update in the
list of installed updates and select to remove the update.

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_16.jpg)

![note](/img/note.jpg)
An alternative to uninstalling an update is to use System Restore to revert
to an earlier time before the update. However, System Protection must
have been turned on before the update was installed. System Protection
in Windows 10 is turned off by default. You can turn it on by clicking the
Start menu, then type Recovery and select it, then clcik Configure System
Restore, Select the System drive, then Configure, Select Turn on System
Protection, and finally click OK.

# Roll_back_devices_drivers
It's rare for a driver update to fail, but sometimes they do. If you install a new driver and
there is an issue, you can use the Rollback Driver feature to revert to the old driver. The
Rollback Driver button is found in Device Manager on the Driver tab of the device.

Rolling back a driver

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_17.jpg)

[Top](#Index)


# Apply_updates
While updates sometime cause issues, in most cases they solve issues. When an issue
involves possible driver problems, check to see whether any of the devices involved have
new updates available. 

You can try this at Windows Update or by going to the vendor
website. Sometimes they have tools that can scan your entire system for potential driver
updates.

In large-scale networks, the organization may employ a corporate patch-management
solution. Microsoft offers a free patch-management solution called Windows Server
Update Services (WSUS). Microsoft also sells a licensed solution called System Center
Configuration Manager (SCCM), which performs many other functions in addition to
patch management. If an update is required and your organization uses one of these
products, the patch must be approved, downloaded, and deployed. Third-party patchmanagement
solutions may also be used in your organization. Third-party solutions are
usually specific to an application or suite of applications, such as Adobe or Autodesk.

In small office, home office (SOHO) environments and small network environments,
the update may be a one-off installation for a specific application. In this case, the update
just needs to be downloaded and installed, per the vendor instructions. Always make sure
to have a plan to roll back from a bad update. Turning on System Protection is a good idea
before the update. If an update fails, you can simply use System Restore to restore the operating
system to a prior point in time.

# Repair_application
To repair an application, consult the application vendor website. Most applications
allow for a repair function if you attempt to reinstall the application when it is already
installed.

If an application is crashing and acting erratically, it may be due to another application
that has overwritten critical files used by the application, or the files may have become corrupted.
In either case, choosing to repair an application will validate it is installed properly
and the process will replace any missing critical files for the application. Data files and configuration
files will not be touched while the application is being repaired; only critical files
(such as DLLs) will be checked and repaired.

You can repair an application by right-clicking the Start menu, selecting Apps and
Features, then Programs and Features (under the Related Settings heading), right-click the
application, and then select Repair, as shown in Figure . 

The application's installer
will launch and start to repair the application.

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_18.jpg)

# Repair_operating_system
In some cases, the easiest way to repair an issue is to completely reinstall the operating
system. This is one of the biggest reasons you should encourage users to store data on servers
rather than the workstation.

 However, operating system vendors are beginning to offer
some options that are less drastic. They have also made it easier to perform various recovery
types with no media.

For example, in Windows 8, 8.1, and 10, there are several options presented when you
choose to repair the computer. They are Refresh, Reset, and Restore. 

The effects of using the three options are as follows:

**Refresh** This reinstalls Windows and keeps your personal files and settings. It also keeps
the apps that came with your PC and the apps you installed from the Windows Store.
Reset This reinstalls Windows but deletes your files, settings, and apps—except for the
apps that came with your PC.

**Restore** This is a way to undo recent system changes you've made by returning the system
configuration to a previous point in time. It does not delete any files or applications, unless
the application was installed after the restore point was taken.

To access these options, follow these steps:


```dos
1. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap Settings, and then tap Change PC Settings. (If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, click Settings, and then click Change PC Settings.)
2. Tap or click Update And Recovery and then tap or click Recovery.
3. You will now see the three options shown in Figure.
```

# Update_boot_order
Bootrec.exe is a tool available on the installation DVD of Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10 that  can be used to repair the following:

- Master boot record (MBR)
- Boot sector
- Boot configuration data (BCD) store

It is a command-line tool that becomes available when you reboot to the installation
CD; to use it, choose Repair Your Computer, select the problematic operating system, and
choose System Recovery Options. In the options presented, choose Command Prompt. 

The command and its options are shown here:
- `Bootrec /fixmbr` : Attempts to repair the master boot record
- `Bootrec /fixboot` : Writes a new boot sector to the system partition
- `Bootrec /scanos`: Scans the systems for supported installations and adds them to the list displayed at bootup
- `Bootrec /rebuildbcd`: Completely rebuilds the BCD store


When you have a multi-boot installation and the wrong operating system is loading, the boot
order must be updated to reflect the proper default. The boot order can be updated a variety
of ways. The first way is to use the System Configuration utility (msconfig.exe) and the Boot
tab, as shown in Figure.

Updating the boot order in System Configuration

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_19.jpg)

You can access the utility by clicking the Start menu, then type
System Configuration and select it from the results, select the Boot tab, select the operating
system, then choose Set as Default. You can tell which operating system is the default and
which operating system is currently booted by looking at their descriptions on the Boot tab.


The second way to update the boot order is through the System Properties on the
Advanced tab (Startup and Recovery), as shown in Figure . 

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_20.jpg)

You can access the
Startup and Recovery dialog box by clicking the Start menu, then typing System, and select
System under the Settings heading, then Advanced System Settings, then the Advanced tab,
then Settings… (Startup and Recovery), select the operating system from the drop-down as
the Default Operating System, as shown 


## There are a variety of other ways to change the boot order, including using the bcdedit.exe utility. 

**You would first use the**

`bcdedit /ENUM` command (to see the various options), and then use the 

`bcdedit /DEFAULT { GUID-ID }` command, replacing GUID-ID with the identifier for the operating system you want to boot as default—for example, 

`bcdedit / DEFAULT { ce10a3ba-801f-11e8-be04-ae230169ca59 }` .

# Disable_Windows_services/applications

In some rare cases it can be a Windows service or a Windows application (those built into
the operating system) that causes the issue. 

Disabling services is a matter of locating the service in the Services console, right-clicking it, and selecting Disable.

For Windows applications you must go to Programs and Features in Control Panel. Locate
the application and disable it from there. On the left side of this dialog box select Turn
Windows Features On and Off. From the next dialog box select the application and disable it.

# Disable_application_startup

A slow start may be the result of too many services and applications starting at startup.
The MSCONFIG utility helps you troubleshoot startup problems by allowing you to selectively
disable individual items that normally are executed at startup. 

There is no menu command
for this utility, so in Windows 10, for example, you use **Start ➢ Run**, type **msconfig**,
and press Enter. 

It works in most versions of Windows, although the interface window is
slightly different among versions.

Disabling applications in Task Manager

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_21.jpg)

After you have identified that a particular program at startup is slowing down the login
process, you need to disable the application to fix the performance issue. 

Applications are
automatically started upon login, as the operating system uses a variety of mechanisms,
such as reading the Registry as well as the Startup folders for both the system and the user.

The Registry keys and the path of the Startup folders read, are as followed:

**Registry**

```dos
- HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
- HKLM\\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
- HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```

**Startup Folders**


```dos
- C:\programdata\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp
- C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
```

# Safe_boot
In many cases, a system will not boot in regular mode but will do so in safe mode. Safe
mode loads the operating system but none of the drivers, with the exception of those absolutely
essential to the system and those required for use of the keyboard, the mouse, and the
basic display (VGA mode).

If the system will start in safe mode but not otherwise, it is most likely a bad driver that
is causing the system to hang during the bootup. 

One option to try for a quick fix is to
perform a System Restore procedure to a point in time before the driver problem occurred.
You can also use the Rollback Driver feature to revert to the older but functional driver.
The problem with this approach is that you have not identified the problem driver, so the
issue may emerge again later.

To access Safe Mode, you must boot into the Windows Recovery Environment. This
can be achieved a number of ways, but the prior method in Windows 7 of pressing
F8 when the operating system is booting to access Advanced boot options no longer
works in Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10.

 To access the Startup Settings (as shown in
Figure ), select Reboot while holding the Shift key, once the computer reboots select
Troubleshoot, then Advanced Options, then See More Recovery Options, then Startup
Settings, and finally Restart.

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_23.jpg)


The Windows Recovery Environment will reboot into the Startup Settings. You can then
choose option 4, Enable Safe Mode. The operating system will boot into Safe Mode, as
shown in Figure. 

Safe Mode will display the words "Safe Mode" in all four corners
while you are booted into this mode. The Windows build and release information will also
be displayed at the top of the screen.

# Rebuild_Windows_profiles

When a problem has been determined to be a profile-related issue, it is necessary to reset
the Windows profile. When performing this action, ensure that the user's data is backed up.
It is best to keep an entire copy of the profile before resetting it. 

The following are the most common places data is kept by the operating system:
- Contacts
- Desktop Items
- Documents
- Favorites
- Links
- Music
- Pictures
- Videos
- Saved Games (optionally)
- Downloads (optionally)
- 3D Objects (optionally)

To back up a local profile, log into an administrative account (other than the one you are
backing up), and then copy the profile under C:\Users to a new location. Do not move the
profile, because the operating system references it in the Registry.

You can then reset a local profile through the Advanced tab of System Properties, as
shown in Figure . 

Deleting a local user profile

![soft](/img/f3.1_Software_TR_OS_Pr_25.jpg)

You can access the User Profiles dialog box by clicking the Start
menu, then typing System, select System under Settings, then Advanced System Settings,
then the Advanced tab, then Settings… (User Profiles), select the profile to reset, click
Delete, then answer Yes to confirm the deletion. Then log in as the user. Windows will create
a new profile. The user's files can then be manually copied over.


**To fix a corrupted user profile on a Windows 7, 8, or 10 computer, follow these steps:**

```dos
1. Go to Control Panel.
2. Go to User Accounts (or Accounts And Family Safety ➢ User Accounts).
3. Click Manage Another Account.
4. Click Create A New Account to create a new account on your computer.
5. Type a name and choose an account type.
6. Click Create Account.
7. Choose Account Type For New User.
8. Open File Explorer or My Computer.
9. Click Tools. If you don't see the Tools item at the top of the window, press the Alt key.
10. Click Folder Options.
11. Go to the View tab.
12. Check the Show Hidden Files And Folders option.
13. Uncheck the Hide Protected Operating System Files option.
14. Click Apply.
15. Click OK.
16. Go to C:\Users\OLD_USERNAME, where C:\ is where your Windows 7 is installed and OLD_USERNAME is the username that has the corrupted profile error.
17. From this folder (OLD_USERNAME), select all files except Ntuser.data, Ntuser.data.log, and Ntuser.ini.
18. Right-click these files (except the files mentioned in the previous step) and click Copy.
19. Go to C:\User\NEW_USERNAME, where NEW_USERNAME is the username you created as new.
20. Paste all files in this folder, NEW_USERNAME.
21. Restart the computer and log in with the new username you've created.
