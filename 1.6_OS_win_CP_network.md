# Network and Sharing Center
In Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10, all network settings have been combined in an applet
called Network And Sharing Center, where many sharing functions have also been relocated.

While most of the tools are dedicated to creating and managing both wireless and
wired network connections, some Advanced sharing functions are available in this applet.
Figure shows this applet.
