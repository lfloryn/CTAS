# dism
**Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM.exe)** is a command-line tool that can
be used to service a Windows image or to prepare a **Windows Preinstallation Environment**

(Windows PE) image. The syntax is as follows:

```dos
DISM.exe {/Image:<path_to_image> | /Online} [dism_global_options]{servicing_option} [<servicing_argument>]
```

For example, to determine whether any corruption exists in the operating system,
execute this command:

```dos
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
```

```dos
c:\> dism /?
