# Network card properties

Like other devices, network cards can be configured to optimize performance.
Configuration is done through the Properties dialog box for each card.

## Half duplex/full duplex/auto

Duplexing is the means by which communication takes place.

- With full duplexing, everyone can send and receive at the same time. The main advantage of full-duplex over half-duplex communication is performance. NICs can operate twice as fast in full-duplex mode as they do normally in half-duplex mode.
- With half duplexing, communications travel in both directions, but in only one direction at any given time. Think of a road where construction is being done on one laneâ€”traffic can go in both directions but in only one direction at a time at that location.
- With auto duplexing, the mode is set to the lowest common denominator. If a card senses another card is manually configured to half duplex, then it also sets itself at that.

Duplexing is set using the Advanced tab on the Properties of the network card, as shown in Figure

# Speed
The speed setting allows you to configure whether the card should run at its highest possible
setting. You often need to be compatible with the network on which the host resides.

If, for example, you are connecting a workstation with a 10/100BaseT card to a legacy
network, you will need to operate at 10 MBps to match the rest of the network. Speed is set
along with duplex, as shown in Figure 6.69.
# Wake-on-LAN
Wake-on-LAN (WoL) is an Ethernet standard implemented via a card that allows a
"sleeping" machine to awaken when it receives a wakeup signal from across the network.
# QoS
Quality of Service (QoS) implements packet scheduling to control the flow of traffic and
help with network transmission speeds. No properties can be configured for the service
itself.
# BIOS (Onboard NIC)
While some older devices may have network cards installed in slots, most devices now have
integrated or built-in network interfaces on the motherboard. While these interfaces will be
recognized and set up automatically, if you find you do not see an integrated interface when
you go to Network And Sharing, you may need to enable the interface in the BIOS.

The
steps to locate this setting are specific to the BIOS on the machine, but if you identify the
BIOS vendor and the version, you should be able to look up the steps on the BIOS vendor
website.
