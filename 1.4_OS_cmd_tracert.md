# Tracert
The tracert command (called traceroute in Linux and Unix) is used to trace the path of a
packet through the network. 

Its best use is in determining exactly where in the network the
packet is being dropped. 

It will show each hop (router) the packet crosses and how long it
takes to do so.

A common scenario for using tracert is when there is a slow remote connection and
you would like to find out which part of the path is problematic.


```dos
Usage: tracert [-d] [-h maximum_hops] [-j host-list] [-w timeout] 
               [-R] [-S srcaddr] [-4] [-6] target_name

Options:
    -d                 Do not resolve addresses to hostnames.
    -h maximum_hops    Maximum number of hops to search for target.
    -j host-list       Loose source route along host-list (IPv4-only).
    -w timeout         Wait timeout milliseconds for each reply.
    -R                 Trace round-trip path (IPv6-only).
    -S srcaddr         Source address to use (IPv6-only).
    -4                 Force using IPv4.
    -6                 Force using IPv6.
```
