# Remote Assistance

Remote Assistance is a tool that allows you to connect to a remote computer to provide
assistance to another user currently logged into that computer. 
When you connect via
Remote Assistance, you do not have to log into that computer; instead, invitations are sent
from the host computer to you so you can take over the computer. 

You can use the remote
computer (the host computer) as if you are sitting in front of it. 

The user on the other end
can watch your activities on-screen. At any time, either user can terminate the session. 

To configure this feature, follow these steps:

1. Enter Remote.
2. Click Settings under the Search box.
3. Click Allow Remote Assistance Invitations To Be Sent From This Computer. The System Properties dialog box appears, with the Remote tab showing.
4. Click Allow Remote Assistance Connections To This Computer, as shown in Figure
5. Click OK.
