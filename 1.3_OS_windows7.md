# Upgrading to Windows 7

If you want to do an upgrade instead of a clean installation, review the upgrade options
innext  Table  (it is worth pointing out again that a "No" does not mean you can't buy the
Windows 7 upgrade but rather that you can't keep your files, programs, and settings).

**Windows 7 upgrade options**

    The Enterprise editions play by different rules since they are licensed directly from Microsoft. In the case of Windows 7, both Windows Vista Business and Windows Vista Enterprise can be upgraded to Windows 7 Enterprise.

Those operating systems not listed in Table  do not include any upgrade options to
Windows 7 and cannot be done with upgrade packages (you must buy the full version of
Windows 7). An easy way to remember upgrade options for the exam is that you must have
at least Windows Vista to be able to upgrade to Windows 7. In the real world, the Windows
Vista machine should be running Service Pack 1 at a minimum, and you can always take an
earlier OS and upgrade it to Vista SP1 and then upgrade to Windows 7.

    As of this writing, Service Pack 1 is the latest available for Windows 7, the  Windows 8.1 upgrade is the latest for Windows 8, and there is no service pack for Windows 8.1. You can find the latest here:

    In the past, all service packs used to be cumulativeâ€”meaning you needed to load only the last one. Starting with XP SP3, however, all Windows service packs released have been incremental, meaning that you must install the previous ones before you can install the new one.

Microsoft created the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor to help with the upgrade to this
operating system. You can download the advisor from http://windows.microsoft.com/
upgradeadvisor . It will scan your hardware, devices, and installed programs for any
known compatibility issues. Once it is fi nished, it will give you advice on how to resolve
the issues found and recommendations on what to do before you upgrade. The reports are
divided into three categories: System Requirements, Devices, and Programs

    Upgrade Advisor
    Other versions of Windows also have Upgrade Advisors!


After all incompatibilities have been addressed, the upgrade can be started from an
installation disc or from a download (preferably to a USB drive). If the setup routine does
not begin immediately on boot, look for the setup.exe fi le and run it. When the Install
Windows page appears, click Install Now.

You'll be asked if you want to get any updates (recommended) and to agree to the license
agreement. After you've done so, choose Upgrade for the installation type and follow the
steps to walk through the remainder of the installation. I highly recommend that after the
installation is complete, you run Windows Update to get the latest drivers.

    New to Windows 7 was the ability to upgrade at any time from one edition of the operating system to a higher one (for example, from Home Premium to Professional) using the Windows Anytime Upgrade utility in the System And Security section of the Control Panel (it can also be accessed by clicking the Start button and choosing All Programs; scroll down the list and choose Windows Anytime Upgrade).
