# Load alternate third-party drivers when necessary

During the installation, it may be necessary to load a third-party driver that you update
later. The goal during installation is to get the operating system up and running and in a
state where you can interact with it. 

Some of the drivers included with media are not the
latest from the vendor but can be used to complete the installation. Once installation is
done, you can access the websites of third-party vendors and download and then install the
latest drivers. 

To add a mass storage driver (which is what you need to access the drive), you
hit the F7 key when you are prompted during the installation.
