# Types of installations

Operating system installations can be lumped into two generic methods: attended or unattended.
During an attended installation, you walk through the installation and answer the
questions as prompted. Questions typically ask for the product key, the directory in which
you want to install the OS, and relevant network settings.

As simple as attended installations may be, they're time-consuming and administratorintensive
in that they require someone to fill in a fair number of fields to move through the process.

Unattended installations allow you to configure the OS with little or no human intervention.
In table we shows you four common unattended installation methods and when they can be used.

Another decision you must make is which method you are going to use to access the
Windows installation files. It is possible to boot to the installation DVD and begin the
installation process. However, your system must have a system BIOS that is capable of supporting
bootable media.

If you don't have a bootable DVD, you must first boot the computer using some other
bootable media, which then loads the disk driver so that you can access the installation
program on the DVD.

## Unattended installation
Answering the myriad of questions posed by Windows Setup doesn't qualify as exciting
work for most people. Fortunately, there is a way to answer the questions automatically:
through an unattended installation. In this type of installation, an answer file is supplied
with all the correct parameters (time zone, regional settings, administrator username, and
so on), so no one needs to be there to tell the computer what to choose or to hit Next 500
times.

Unattended installations are great because they can be used to upgrade operating
systems. The first step is to create an answer file. This XML file, which must be named
unattend.xml, contains configuration settings specific to the computer on which you are
installing the OS, which means that for every installation the answer file will be unique.
See the following for details on these settings:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/update-windows-settings-and-scripts-create-your-own-answer-file-sxs

Generally speaking, you'll want to run a test installation using that answer file first
before deploying it on a large scale because you'll probably need to make some tweaks to it.

After you create your answer file, place it on a network share that will be accessible from
the target computer. (Most people put it in the same place as the Windows installation files
for convenience.)

Boot the computer that you want to install on using a boot disk or CD, and establish
the network connection. Once you start the setup process, everything should run
automatically.

## In-place upgrade
An upgrade involves moving from one operating system to another and keeping as many of
the settings as possible. An example of an upgrade would be changing the operating system
on a laptop computer from Windows Vista to Windows 7 and keeping the user accounts
that existed.

It is also possible to upgrade from one edition of an operating system to anotherâ€”
for example, from Windows 7 Professional to Windows 7 Ultimate. This is known as a
Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade.

To begin the upgrade, insert the DVD, and the Setup program should automatically
begin (if it doesn't, run setup.exe from the root folder). From the menu that appears,
choose Install Now and then select Upgrade when the Which type Of Installation Do You
Want? screen appears. Answer the prompts to walk through the upgrade.

Booting from the DVD is also possible but recommended only if the method just
described does not work. When you boot, you will get a message upon startup that says
Press Any Key To Boot From CD, and at this point you simply press a key. (Don't worry
that it is a DVD and not a CD.)

## Clean install
With a clean installation, you delete the volume where the old operating system existed and
place a new one there. An example of a clean installation would be changing the operating
system on a laptop from Windows 8 to Windows 10. The user accounts and other settings
that existed with Windows 8 would be removed in the process and need to be re-created
under Windows 10.

## Repair installation
A repair installation overwrites system files with a copy of new ones from the same operating
system version and edition. For example, a laptop running Windows 7 is hanging on
boot, and the cause is traced to a corrupted system file. A repair installation can replace
that corrupted file with a new one (from the DVD or other source) without changing the
operating system or settings (for configuration, accounts, and so on).

## Multiboot
Multiple operating systems can exist on the same machine in one of two popular formats:
in a multiboot configuration or in virtual machines. With a multiboot configuration,
when you boot the machine, you choose which operating system you want to load of those
that are installed. You could, for example, boot into Windows 10, reboot and bring up
Windows 7, reboot and bring up Windows 8, and test a software application you've created
in each OS. It is possible in this scenario to have multiple editions of the same OS installed
(Professional, Ultimate, and so forth) and choose which to boot into in order to test your
application. The key to this configuration, however, is that you can have only one operating
system running at a time.

Each installation should have its own folder. Make sure you don't install into a folder
that already contains an OS or you will overwrite it.

An alternative to multiboot that has become more popular in recent years is to run virtual
machines. You could boot into Windows 7, for example, and run a virtual machine
of Windows 10 and one of Windows 8 and test your application in the three environments
that are all running at the same time.

## Remote network installation
Older Windows Server operating systems have a feature called Remote Installation Service
(RIS), which allows you to perform several network installations at one time. Beginning
with Windows Server 2003 SP2, RIS was replaced by Windows Deployment Service
(WDS). This utility offers the same functionality as RIS.

A network installation is handy when you have many installs to do and installing by
CD is too much work. In a network installation, the installation CD is copied to a shared
location on the network. Then individual workstations boot and access the network share.
The workstations can boot either through a boot disk or through a built-in network boot
device known as a PXE ROM. 

Boot ROMs essentially download a small fi le that contains
an OS and network drivers and has enough information to boot the computer in a limited
fashion. At the least, it can boot the computer so it can access the network share and begin
the installation.

## Creating an image
Creating an image isn't actually an objective, but it is something important that you'll need
to know how to do in the real world. Creating an image involves taking a snapshot of a
model system (often called a reference computer ) and then applying it to other systems (see
the section "Image deployment" later). A number of third-party vendors offer packages
that can be used to create images, and you can use the system preparation tool, or Sysprep .
The Sysprep utility works by making an exact image or replica of the reference computer
(sometimes also called the master computer ) to be installed on other computers. Sysprep
removes the master computer's security ID (a process sometimes called generalization ) and
will generate new IDs for each computer where the image is used to install.

![Note](/img/note.jpg)

*All Sysprep does is create the system image. You still need a cloning utility to copy the image to other computers.*

Perhaps the biggest caveat to using Sysprep is that because you are making an exact
image of an installed computer (including drivers and settings), all the computers that you
will be installing the image on need to be identical (or close) to the confi guration of the
master computer. Otherwise, you would have to go through and fi x driver problems on
every installed computer. Sysprep images can be installed across a network or copied to a
CD or DVD for local installation. Sysprep cannot be used to upgrade a system; plan on all
data on the system (if there is any) being lost after a format.

![Note](/img/note.jpg)

*Similar to Sysprep, ImageX is the preferred command-line utility for imaging Windows 7 and other version of Windows . You can find more information about it at :*
*http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722145(v=ws.10)*

Several third-party vendors provide similar services, and you'll often hear the process
referred to as disk imaging or drive imaging . The third-party utility makes the image, and
then the image fi le is transferred to the computer without an OS. You boot the new system
with the imaging software and start the image download. The new system's disk drive is
made into an exact sector-by-sector copy of the original system.

Imaging has major upsides. The biggest one is speed. In larger networks with multiple
new computers, you can configure tens to hundreds of computers by using imaging in just
hours, rather than the days it would take to individually install the OS, applications, and
drivers.

## Image deployment
System images created with Sysprep and other tools can be deployed for installation on
hosts across the network. The Windows Automated Installation Kit (AIK) can be useful for
this purpose (http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd349348.aspx).

## Recovery partition
In the past, many devices that were purchased with the operating system installed by the
OEM came with recovery media that could be used to boot the device and recover or
replace the operating system if needed. Now many come with an additional partition on the
drive called a recovery partition. The users could use a specific key sequence during bootup
that would cause the device to boot to the recovery partition and make available tools to
either recover the installation or replace it. The downside of this approach is that if the hard
drive fails or if the partition is overwritten, the recovery partition is useless. In an effort to
address this concern, many OEMs now make available recovery media if requested by the
user.

## Refresh/restore/reset
Windows 8, 8.1, and 10 offer three methods of dealing with a device that either won't
boot, is corrupted, or is simply performing badly. These three options are refresh, restore,
and reset; and it is critical that you understand the consequences of each. When a refresh is
performed, the user's data is unaffected, while the operating system is returned to the factory
default state. Although the data remains intact, any applications or programs that the
user installed will be gone. All default applications that come with the system will remain,
and any purchased from the Windows Store will remain as well. When a restore is performed,
the system is restored to a point in time in the past. It removes no user data, but
any configuration changes made or programs and service packs installed since that point in
time will be gone. Finally, the third and most drastic option is the reset, which removes all
data and programs and reinstalls a fresh copy of the operating system.
