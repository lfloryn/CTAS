# Troubleshooting

Available in Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10, this applet **(Start ➢ Control Panel ➢
Troubleshooting)** is used to provide a simple interface to attack many common problems.
All links preceded by a shield require administrator permissions to run and are often
tied to UAC prompts before continuing. 

Most of the problems found will be "automatically
fixed" without any prompts. For example, clicking the link Improve Power Usage
will start the Power Troubleshooter and then fix problems that it identifies. 

Clicking the
link to get help from a friend brings up Remote Assistance, allowing someone to connect
to this computer.
