# Use remote access technologies.
### Index 

As an A+ technician, there will be times when you need to make a remote connection to
another device for the purpose of managing the device. In this section, we'll look at some of
the options for this and the security issues with each.

# RDP
Remote Desktop, which is not included in the Home editions of the Windows operating systems,
allows members of the Administrators group to gain access to the workstation. (You
can specifically allow other users as well.) By default, Remote Desktop is not enabled on
Windows 7, but you can enable it from Remote Settings in the Control Panel applet System
And Security. To enable Remote Desktop connections in Windows 7, follow these steps:


```dos
1. Right-click the Computer icon and choose Properties, or you can type system into the Start menu search box and then find the entry for System.
2. Click the Remote Settings link on the left side.
3. Select one of the two options allowing Remote Desktop connections, as shown in Figure
```

**To enable Remote Desktop connections in Windows 8, 8.1, and 10, follow these steps:** 

```apache
1. Open the desktop Control Panel and find the System panel there, or you can search for Remote Access in the Start menu or Start screen.
2. Click Allow Remote Access To Your Computer.
3. When the System Properties dialog box appears, select to allow Remote Desktop connections, as shown in Figure
```

# Telnet
Although a Telnet client comes on every Windows machine, the client is not installed by
default. It is a handy tool to have, as it allows you to connect to a device at the command
line and work at the command line. You should know, however, that Telnet transmits
in clear text, so you would not want to use it to perform any sensitive operations (like
changing a password). 

Run PowerShell as Administrator 
```powershell
dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:TelnetClient
```

# SSH
If you don't need access to the graphical interface and you just want to operate at the command
line, you have two options, Telnet and SSH. While Telnet works just fine, it transmits
all of the data in clear text, which obviously would be a security issue. Therefore, the connection
tool of choice has become Secure Shell (SSH). It's not as easy to set up, because it
encrypts all of the transmissions, and that is not possible without an encryption key.

While the commands will be somewhat different based on the operating system, you
must generate a key, which is generated using some unique information about the server as
seed information so that the key will be unique to the server (the encryption algorithm will
be well known). Once configured, the connection process will be similar to using Telnet,
with the exception of course that the transmissions will be protected.

# Third-party tools
There are also third-party tools that sometimes include screen and file sharing features.
Let's briefly discuss these capabilities.

# Screen share feature
Many of the collaboration or meeting software packages such Go to Meeting, WebEx, and
Adobe Connect offer a screen sharing option. These are also possible in third-party remote
access software such as Go To My PC, LogMeIn, and Remote PC.

# File share
Many of the collaboration or meeting software packages such Go to Meeting, WebEx, and
Adobe Connect also offer a file sharing option. In many collaboration solutions, multiple
users can even edit a document at the same time. These are also possible in third-party
remote access software such as Go To My PC, LogMeIn, and Remote PC.

# Security considerations of each access method
Except for Telnet, which is completely insecure, RDP and third-party methods are generally
secure and encrypted. However, you should ensure the following about the solution
you select:

RDP Ensure that all passwords are complex and that rights are restricted to the minimum to do the job.

SSH Ensure that all passwords are complex and that rights are restricted to the minimum to do the job.

Third-Party Methods Ensure that you understand the security capabilities and the shortcomings of the specific method under consideration.
