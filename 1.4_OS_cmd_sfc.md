# sfc
The **System File Checker (SFC)** is a command line–based utility that checks and verifies the
versions of system files on your computer. If system files are corrupted, the SFC will replace
the corrupted files with correct versions.

## The syntax for the SFC command is as follows:

```dos
SFC [switch]
```

```dos
C:\> sfc /?

Microsoft (R) Windows (R) Resource Checker Version 6.0
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

Scans the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with
correct Microsoft versions.

SFC [/SCANNOW] [/VERIFYONLY] [/SCANFILE=<file>] [/VERIFYFILE=<file>]
    [/OFFWINDIR=<offline windows directory> /OFFBOOTDIR=<offline boot directory> [/OFFLOGFILE=<log file path>]]

/SCANNOW        Scans integrity of all protected system files and repairs files with
                problems when possible.
/VERIFYONLY     Scans integrity of all protected system files. No repair operation is
                performed.
/SCANFILE       Scans integrity of the referenced file, repairs file if problems are
                identified. Specify full path <file>
/VERIFYFILE     Verifies the integrity of the file with full path <file>.  No repair
                operation is performed.
/OFFBOOTDIR     For offline repair, specify the location of the offline boot directory
/OFFWINDIR      For offline repair, specify the location of the offline windows directory
/OFFLOGFILE     For offline repair, optionally enable logging by specifying a log file path

e.g.

        sfc /SCANNOW
        sfc /VERIFYFILE=c:\windows\system32\kernel32.dll
        sfc /SCANFILE=d:\windows\system32\kernel32.dll /OFFBOOTDIR=d:\ /OFFWINDIR=d:\windows
        sfc /SCANFILE=d:\windows\system32\kernel32.dll /OFFBOOTDIR=d:\ /OFFWINDIR=d:\windows /OFFLOGFILE=c:\log.txt
        sfc /VERIFYONLY
```


To run the SFC, you must be logged in as an administrator or have administrative
privileges. If the System File Checker discovers a corrupted system fi le, it will automatically
overwrite the fi le by using a copy held in the %systemroot%\system32\dllcache directory.
If you believe that the dllcache directory is corrupted, you can use SFC /SCANNOW ,
SFC /SCANONCE , SFC /SCANBOOT , or SFC /PURGECACHE , depending on your needs, as
described  , to repair its contents.

![Note](/img/note.jpg)
The C:\Windows\System32 directory is where many of the Windows system files reside.

If you attempt to run SFC, or many other utilities, from a standard command prompt,
you will be told that you must be an administrator running a console session in order to
continue. Rather than opening a standard command prompt, choose **Start ➢ All Programs
➢ Accessories** and then right-click **Command Prompt** and choose **Run As Administrator**.

The User Account Control (UAC) will prompt you to continue, and then you can run SFC
without a problem.
