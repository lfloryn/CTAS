# Windows Firewall

As the name implies, the Windows Firewall applet can be used to manage the firewall
included with the operating system. Figure shows an example. In this case, the
computer's firewall settings are being managed by the domain administrator. When the
computer is outside of that network, the firewall settings are available to the user of the
computer.
