# **Summarize general OS installation considerations and upgrade methods.**

When installing or upgrading an operating system, it is important to know what is possible
and what is not. 
Not all systems can be directly upgraded to the newest version. 
Some must be completely reinstalled. In this section, we'll look at some possible upgrade paths and
other installation considerations. This section covers the following topics:
- [Boot methods](1.3_OS_boot_method.md)
- [Types of installations](1.3_OS_type_of_instalation.md)
- [Partitioning](1.3_OS_partition.md)
- [File system types/formatting](1.3_OS_fylesystem_types.md)
- [Load alternate third-party drivers when necessary](1.3_OS_load_drivers.md)
- Workgroup vs. domain setup
- Time/date/region/language settings
- Driver installation, software, and Windows updates
- Factory recovery partition
- Properly formatted boot drive with the correct partitions/format
- Prerequisites/hardware compatibility
- Application compatibility
- OS compatibility/upgrade path


## Upgrade paths
There are several things to be aware of regarding upgrade paths, including the differences
between in-place upgrades, the available compatibility tools, and the Windows Upgrade Advisor.

## Differences between in-place upgrades
One Windows operating system can often be upgraded to another, if compatible. With the
case of Windows 7, it is even possible to upgrade from one edition of the operating system to
another. When you are faced with a scenario in which you cannot upgrade, you can always
do a clean installation. There's one more thing to consider when evaluating installation methods.
Some methods work only if you're performing a clean installation and not an upgrade.
Table will lists the minimum system requirements, which are the same for the various
editions of Windows 7.

**Windows 7 minimum hardware**

**Windows 10 minimum hardware**

If there is one thing to be learned  it is that Microsoft is
nothing if not optimistic. For your own sanity, though, I strongly suggest you always take
the minimum requirements with a grain of salt. They are minimums. Even the recommended
requirements should be considered minimums. Bottom line: Make sure you have
a good margin between your system's performance and the minimum requirements listed.
Always run Windows on more hardware rather than less!


### Certain features in Windows 7 have further hardware requirements that are listed here:

The easiest way to see whether your current hardware can run Windows 7 is to download and run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor available here:

    http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor

You can also always check hardware in the Windows 7 Compatibility Center here:

## Time/date/region/language settings
During installation of the operating system, you are asked to choose the correct settings
for the local time, date, and region. As mentioned earlier, the goal during installation is to
complete the process as quickly as possible, and you may need to tweak these settings later.

Once the installation is complete, there are a number of ways to change these values,
the easiest of which is to right-click the clock in the lower-right corner of the taskbar and
choose Adjust Date/Time. In the Control Panel, you can choose the Region And Language
applet to configure date and time formats, as well as change language and location settings.

**Language interface packs (LIPs**) are available that can be installed to modify what appears
in wizards, dialog boxes, and such (see http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Install-or-change-a-display-language for more information).

## Driver installation, software, and Windows updates
During the installation process of Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Window 10,
you will be presented with the option to download any required updates and new driver
packages that may have become available since the time the installation DVD was created.

If the device will have an active Internet connection, you may want to take advantage of
this because it will download the required files and make them part of the installation. If
this is not an option, you can always perform this step by visiting Windows Update after
the installation.

## Factory recovery partition
A recovery partition is one created in Windows that makes returning the device to its factory
settings possible. This can also be used to revive the system when it fails. Although it is
possible to delete this partition, it is not advisable as it will limit recovery options.
Properly formatted boot drive with the correct

## partitions/format
Clearly it important to properly create and format the boot drive prior to the installation.
Please review the sections "Partitioning," "File system types/formatting," and "Quick format
vs. full format."

## Prerequisites/hardware compatibility
Prior to installing or upgrading an OS, it is advisable to ensure that the system supports
all the hardware prerequisites (these were provided earlier in this chapter). It also is a good
idea to check whether any additional hardware is compatible with the system. The upgrade
advisors provided with many upgrade programs can assist with this as well. If you don't
check ahead of time, the installation or upgrade may fail when you attempt it.

## Application compatibility
This is another area where some prior research can be invaluable. Applications are made
to work on specific operating systems. While you'll have fewer problems with an upgrade,
a new installation, especially when going from one vendor to another (Windows to Apple)
may result in application incompatibility. The upgrade advisors mentioned earlier can also
assess your application's compatibility.

## OS compatibility/upgrade path
Keep in mind that some upgrades are not possible and require new installations. See the
tables earlier in this chapter on allowable upgrade paths.
