# **Summarize general OS installation considerations and upgrade methods.**

When installing or upgrading an operating system, it is important to know what is possible
and what is not. 
Not all systems can be directly upgraded to the newest version. 
Some must be completely reinstalled. In this section, we'll look at some possible upgrade paths and
other installation considerations. This section covers the following topics:
- Boot methods
- Types of installations
- Partitioning
- File system types/formatting
- Load alternate third-party drivers when necessary
- Workgroup vs. domain setup
- Time/date/region/language settings
- Driver installation, software, and Windows updates
- Factory recovery partition
- Properly formatted boot drive with the correct partitions/format
- Prerequisites/hardware compatibility
- Application compatibility
- OS compatibility/upgrade path


## Upgrade paths
There are several things to be aware of regarding upgrade paths, including the differences
between in-place upgrades, the available compatibility tools, and the Windows Upgrade Advisor.

## Differences between in-place upgrades
One Windows operating system can often be upgraded to another, if compatible. With the
case of Windows 7, it is even possible to upgrade from one edition of the operating system to
another. When you are faced with a scenario in which you cannot upgrade, you can always
do a clean installation. There's one more thing to consider when evaluating installation methods.
Some methods work only if you're performing a clean installation and not an upgrade.
Table will lists the minimum system requirements, which are the same for the various
editions of Windows 7.

**Windows 7 minimum hardware**

**Windows 10 minimum hardware**

If there is one thing to be learned  it is that Microsoft is
nothing if not optimistic. For your own sanity, though, I strongly suggest you always take
the minimum requirements with a grain of salt. They are minimums. Even the recommended
requirements should be considered minimums. Bottom line: Make sure you have
a good margin between your system's performance and the minimum requirements listed.
Always run Windows on more hardware rather than less!


### Certain features in Windows 7 have further hardware requirements that are listed here:

The easiest way to see whether your current hardware can run Windows 7 is to download and run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor available here:
