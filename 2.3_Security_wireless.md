# Compare and contrast wireless security protocols and authentication methods.
### Index 

CompTIA wants administrators of SOHO networks to be able to secure those networks in
ways that protect the data stored on them. This objective looks at the security protection
that can be added to a wireless or wired SOHO network. The subobjectives covered in this
chapter include the following:

- Protocols and encryption
- Authentication

# Protocols and encryption
More and more, networks are using wireless as the medium of choice. It is much easier to
implement, reconfigure, upgrade, and use than wired networks. Unfortunately, there can be
downsides, and security is one of the largest.

The 802.11 standard applies to wireless networking, and there have been many versions
of it released; the main ones are a, b, g, n, and ac. Encryption has gone from very weak
(WEP) to much stronger with increments along the way, including WPA, WPA2, and implementations
of TKIP and AES.

Wireless protocols are covered in detail in Chapter "Networking".

# WEP
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) was the standard created as a first stab at security for
wireless devices. It is now considered one of the most vulnerable protocols available for
security; 

# WPA
The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) technologies
were designed to address the core problems with WEP. These technologies implement
the 802.11i standard.

WPA implements most—but not all—of 802.11i to communicate
with older wireless cards (which might still need an update through their firmware to be
compliant), while WPA2 implements the full standard and is not compatible with older
cards.

# WPA2
WPA2 implements the full 802.11i standard for security and is not compatible with older
wireless cards.

# TKIP
WPA was able to increase security by using a **Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)** to
scramble encryption keys using a hashing algorithm. 

The keys are issued an integrity check to
verify they have not been modifi ed or tampered with during transit. While a good solution,
it was far from perfect. 

Corporate security today favors WPA2 since it replaces TKIP with
Counter Mode with Cipher Block **Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP)**.

# AES

CCMP uses 128-bit **Advanced Encryption Security (AES)** with a 48-bit initialization vector,
making it much more diffi cult to crack and minimizing the risk of a replay attack.

## WPA and WPA2
While WPA and WPA2 are primarily covered in Chapter 2, we need to say a few words
more about these protocols. There are four variants, as described in Table .

Never assume that a wireless connection is secure. The emissions from
a wireless portal may be detectable through walls and for several blocks
from the portal. Interception is easy to accomplish, given that RF is the
medium used for communication. Newer wireless devices offer data security,
and you should use it. You can set newer WAPs and wireless routers
to nonbroadcast. This is also sometimes called disabling the broadcast of
the SSID. Given the choice, you should choose to use WPA2, WPA, or WEP
at its highest encryption level in that order.

# Authentication
Authentication occurs when a user provides a username (identifi cation) and then proper
credentials (the authentication). In this section, we'll look at the types of authentication and
then at authentication, accounting, and authorization (AAA) services.

#Single-factor
As discussed under "Mutifactor authentication" earlier, there are three factors of authentication:
knowledge factors (something you know, such as a password), characteristic factors
(some physical characteristic, such as a thumbprint), and behavioral factors (something you
do, such as a voice analysis). When only one type is used (for example, password only), it is
called single-factor.

# Multifactor
When two different types of factors are required (such as something you know and something
you have), it is called multifactor authentication. It is important for you to understand
that using two or more of the same type of factors (such as a password and a PIN,
both something you know) is not multifactor authentication. However, when multifactor
authentication is used for mobile devices, the level of security is significantly increased.

# RADIUS/TACACS

When users are making connections to the network through a variety of mechanisms, they
should be authenticated first. These users could be accessing the network through any of
the following:

- Dial-up remote access servers
- VPN access servers
- Wireless access points
- Security-enabled switches

At one time each of these access devices would perform the authentication process
locally on the device. The administrators would need to ensure that all remote access policies
and settings were consistent across them all. When a password required changing, it
had to be done on all devices.

To streamline this process, the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS)
and Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+) networking protocols
were developed to provide centralized authentication and authorization. 

These services
can be run at a central location, and all the access devices, such as the access point (AP),
remote access, virtual private network (VPN), and so on, can be made clients of the server.
Whenever authentication occurs, the TACACS+ or RADIUS server performs the authentication
and authorization. This provides one location to manage the remote access policies
and passwords for the network.

Another advantage of using these systems is that the audit and access information (logs)
are not kept on the access server.

TACACS and TACACS+ are Cisco proprietary services that operate in Cisco devices,
whereas RADIUS is a standard defined in RFC 2138. Cisco has implemented several versions
of TACACS over time. It went from TACACS to XTACACS to the latest version,
TACACS+. The latest version provides authentication, accounting, and authorization,
which is why it is sometimes referred to as an AAA service. 

TACACS+ employs tokens for two-factor, dynamic password authentication. It also allows users to change their
passwords.

RADIUS is designed to provide a framework that includes three components. The
supplicant is the device seeking authentication. The authenticator is the device to which
they are attempting to connect (AP, switch, remote access server), and the RADIUS server
is the authentication server. Note that the device seeking entry is not the RADIUS client.
The authenticating server is the RADIUS server, and the authenticator (AP, switch, remote
access server) is the RADIUS client.

In some cases, a RADIUS server can be the client of another RADIUS server. In that
case, the RADIUS server acts as a proxy client for its RADIUS clients.
