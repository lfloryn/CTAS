# HomeGroup
In Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10 is an applet called HomeGoup. The purpose of HomeGroup
(Start Control Panel HomeGroup) is to simplify home networking (the sharing of files
and printers). Figure 6.53 shows the Homegroup applet for a device that is not currently
connected to its home network. Windows 7 Starter can only join a HomeGroup, while all
other editions of Windows 7 can both join and create a HomeGroup. The location must be
set to Home.


Shared files can include libraries (a big feature of Windows 7). All computers participating
in the HomeGroup must be running Windows 7, Windows 8, or Windows 8.1, and the
network cannot extend outside of the small group.

If a Windows 10 computer is part of a domain, the user can only join an existing
Homegroup, not create one.
