# System utilities

## MSCONFIG 
Discussed previously, the MSConfig configuration utility is useful for
looking at start-related settings.

## REGEDIT 
Used to open and edit the Registry. Regedit does not have save or
undo features (though you can import and export); once you make a
change, you've made the change for better or worse, and this is not
a place to play around in if you're not sure what you're doing. 

The
Registry is divided into five "hives" that hold all settings. The two
main hives are HKEY_USERS (which contains settings for all users)
and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (which contains settings for the machine
itself). HKEY_CURRENT_USER is a subset of HKEY_USERS, holding
information only on the current user. HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG and
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT are both subsets of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
for the current configuration.

## COMMAND

 Starts a command prompt window intentionally designed to have
the look and feel of a DOS command line. Because it is, despite its
appearance, a Windows program, the command prompt provides all
the stability and configurability you expect from Windows.

## SERVICES.MSC 

An MMC snap-in that allows you to interact with the services running
on the computer. The status of the services will typically be
either started or stopped, and you can right-click and choose Start,
Stop, Pause, Resume, or Restart from the context menu. 

Services
can be started automatically or manually, or they can be disabled. If
you right-click the service and choose Properties from the context
menu, you can choose the startup type as well as see the path to the
executable and any dependencies.

MMC Starts the management console, allowing you to run any snap-in (such
as SERVICES.MSC)

## MSTSC 

Remote Desktop Connection Usage is used to configure remote
desktop connections.


## NOTEPAD 
Starts a simple editor. You can edit a file that already exists or create a
new one.

## EXPLORER 
Starts the Windows interface, allowing you to interact with files and
folders

## MSINFO32
 The System Information dialog box, this tool displays a thorough list
of settings on the machine. You cannot change any values from here,
but you can search, export, save, and run a number of utilities. It is
primarily used during diagnostics because it is an easy way to display
settings such as IRQs and DMAs.


##DXDIAG 
The DirectX Diagnostic tool (which has the executable name dxdiag)
allows you to test DirectX functionality, with a focus on display,
sound, and input. When started, you can also verify that your drivers
have been signed by Microsoft. DirectX is a collection of APIs related
to multimedia.

## Defrag 
Defrag is a tool that can be used to reorganize the data on a drive such
that all parts of each file are located in the same place, improving
performance.

## System Restore 
System Restore is a tool that can be used to create restore points, or
snapshots of a system at certain points in time that can be returned to
when a system gets corrupted. When a restore is performed, it leaves
all data unaltered but returns the operating system settings to the
state they were in when the restore point was created.

## Windows Update 
Windows Update is a tool that can be used to automate the process
of checking for updates and patches. Once the feature is enabled,
the system will check with the Update website for missing patches
on a schedule and keep the device up-to-date.

 You have four choices
for the update process: Install Updates Automatically downloads
the updates and installs them when they are available;
