# Explain the processes for addressing prohibited content/activity, and privacy, licensing, and policy concepts.
### Index 

Working in the IT profession, it is entirely plausible that you will encounter a situation
where you find proof of a user, or a number of users, engaging in activities that are prohibited.

Those activities can include any number of things, and the prohibition may range from
a company policy (you cannot use social media during working hours) all the way up to a
federal law (you cannot traffic in child pornography). You have an obligation to respond
appropriately and accordingly.

Regardless of whether you agree with a prohibition, when you encounter instances
wherein activities are in violation of it, you must respond in a professional and legal manner.

**The following are the subobjectives covered in this section:**

# Incident_response

The extent to which a security event causes harm to your network largely depends on
the speed and quality of your response to the incident. 

By following a structured incident
response policy, you greatly enhance the chances of minimizing the damage and the
likelihood that you will be able to bring parties to justice in the case of illegal activity. 

The
following sections cover some important guidelines regarding the incident response process.

## First response
There are three crucial components to the fi rst response: identifying the problem, reporting
it through the proper channels, and preserving the data.
Identify

A part of identifying the problem involves identifying what policy or law prohibits such an
action. Prohibited content generally falls within the following categories (this list should
not be considered to represent everything prohibited, because many companies have other
policies):

- Exploiting people (in any way, such as sexually, violently, and so on)
- Promoting harassment of any person or group
- Containing or promoting anything illegal or unauthorized
- Promoting racism, hatred, bigotry, or physical harm
- Containing adult content involving nudity or sexual acts
- Violating privacy rights, copyrights, contract rights, or defamation rights
- Viruses or malware of any sort
- Impersonation
- Soliciting information from anyone younger than 18
- Involving pyramid schemes, junk mail, chain letters, spamming, or the like Report through proper channels

Once you have identified prohibited content or activity, you must report it through the
proper channels. If the violation is one only of company policy, then usually the company's
human resources department is the proper channel. If the violation is of a law, then often
you must contact legal authoritiesâ€”notifying the appropriate internal resources as well.
If the violation is of a federal law and you tell only an internal resource (HR manager, for
example), it does not absolve you of the responsibility if that person does not continue to
report it up the appropriate chain.

Law enforcement personnel are governed by the rules of evidence, and
their response to an incident will be largely out of your control. You need
to carefully consider involving law enforcement before you begin. There is
no such thing as dropping charges. Once they begin, law enforcement professionals
are required to pursue an investigation.

## Data/device preservation
You have as well an obligation to preserve the content found until it is turned over to
the appropriate authority. Doing so may require commandeering anything from a fl ash
drive up to a network server. Until someone in a position of authority relieves you of the
responsibility, you must preserve the data or device in the state in which you discovered it.

If you are ever unsure of how to proceed, you should immediately contact your supervisor.

Because knowing what to do when something is discovered is something that may
not come naturally, it is a good idea to include the procedures you'll generally follow
in an incident response plan (IRP). The IRP outlines what steps are needed and who is
responsible for deciding how to handle a situation.

Your policies should clearly outline who needs to be informed in the company,
what they need to be told, and how to respond to the situation.

## Use of documentation/documentation changes
During the entire process, you should document the steps you take to identify, detect, and
report the problem. This information is valuable and will often be used should the problem
escalate to a court of law. Many help-desk software systems provide detailed methods you
can use to record procedures and steps.

## Chain of custody
An important concept to keep in mind when working with incidents is the chain of custody .

## Tracking of evidence/documenting process
When you begin to collect evidence, you must keep track of that evidence at all times and
show who has it, who has seen it, and where it has been, known as the chain of custody .

The evidence must always be within your custody, or you're open to dispute about whether
it has been tampered with.

# Licensing/DRM/EULA

While many in the IT community would like to think that software, music files, and
movie files should be free, that is not the case. Using any of these items without paying
for them is illegal . Operating systems, application software, and many third-party
utilities require a license to legally use the software. It also requires that you accept an
end-user license agreement (EULA) whereby you agree to use the software as described in
that agreement.

Music and movie files, on the other hand, are protected by digital rights management
(DRM). This is a system that maintains control over these files and ensures that they are
installed only on devices that belong to the person who purchased the fi le, with the end
goal being to prevent users from sharing and giving these files away without paying for
them.

Not all software requires a license. In the next sections, we'll talk about software that
doesn't require a license and also discuss the differences between personal and enterprise
licenses.

## Open-source vs. commercial license
Open source software is software that is free and available to all. Commercial software,
on the other hand, requires the purchase of a license to legally use the software. While
there is the obvious monetary advantage to using open source software, the organization
or user must typically have a deeper understanding of the software than may be required
to use commercial software successfully. 

Another advantage of commercial software is the
ongoing support the vendor can provide in using the software, while a user of open source
software is pretty much on their own when issues arise. The good news is that open source
software has large, active user communities, though it may be that their information can't
be as authoritative as manufacturer support.

## Personal license vs. enterprise licenses
While an individual software license entitles a single user to install and use a piece of commercial
software, an enterprise license purchase is based on a number of seats or devices on
which the software can be legally installed. Also, while each individual license will come
with installation media, the purchase of an enterprise license comes with a single version
of the installation media, which can be installed on the number of devices specified in the
license agreement.

# Regulated_data

Some data types require special attention because they are regulated. This means their
proper handling is specified by regulation. In this section we'll look at some of these types
of data.

## PII
Personally identifiable information (PII) is any piece of information about a user that can
be used alone or in combination with other pieces of information to identify an individual
user. While it is the responsibility of all organizations to protect PII that they may possess,
it is especially important in certain regulated industries such as healthcare and finance.
The danger of leaking PII is that much of this information, such as address, Social
Security number, and place of employment can be used to perform identity theft, a growing
concern worldwide.
## PCI
PCI-DSS v3.2, developed in April 2015, is the latest version of the PCI-DSS standard as of
this writing. It encourages and enhances cardholder data security and facilitates the broad
adoption of consistent data security measures globally.
## GDPR
Beginning on May 25, 2018, the members of the EU began applying the **General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR)**. 

The GDPR applies to EU-based organizations that collect
or process the personal data of EU residents and to organizations outside the EU that monitor
behavior or offer goods and services to EU residents. It gives a wider definition of personal
and sensitive data to include online identifiers and genetic and biometrics data, such
as cookies, IP address, health information, biometric data, and genetic information. 

The
GDPR affects service providers that process personal data on behalf of an organization,
including cloud services, call centers, and payroll services. It strengthens individual privacy
rights.

## PHI
**Protected health information (PHI)**, also referred to as electronic protected health
information (EPHI or ePHI), is any individually identifiable health information. **NIST**
SP 800-66 provides guidelines for implementing the **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)** Security Rule.

# Follow_all_policies_and_security_best_practices

Every organization should have a security policy that drives all security-related activities
and clearly spells out how sensitive data is handled and what specific operations the users
are allowed to perform. The acceptable use policy is a document that each user should sign
when hired and serves as a contract between the user and the company in detail. Moreover,
this document, as well as the security guidelines that network technicians must follow,
should be driven by well-established best practices. 

The following are some of the guidelines that should be included:
- Password policy
- Acceptable use policy
- Access control policy
- Remote access policy
Part of your job is to educate users about the importance of these security policies and to
monitor the environments for any violations of the policies.

![notes](/img/note.jpg)
Report prohibited content and activities. You have an obligation to report prohibited
activities and content to the appropriate authorities when you uncover them. You must
ascertain which authority is prohibiting the actions and notify them.

![notes](/img/note.jpg)
Document and preserve the evidence. It is imperative that the evidence be documented
and preserved until turned over to the appropriate authority. In some cases, this can include
commandeering a removable drive, a computer, or even a server. Failure to do so can leave
you facing fines and other punishments.
