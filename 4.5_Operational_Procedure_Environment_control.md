# Explain environmental impacts and appropriate controls.
### Index 

Environmental harm can come from many sources. Not only are temperature and humidity
elements that must be controlled, but administrators also need to carefully monitor power,
air, and particulates that can harm humans and computers. Not understanding environmental
impact and controls can cause great harm. 

**The following are the subobjectives covered in this section:**

- MSDS documentation for handling and disposal
- Temperature, humidity-level awareness, and proper ventilation
- Power surges, brownouts, blackouts
- Protection from airborne particles
- Dust and debris
- Compliance with government regulations

# MSDS documentation for handling and disposal
It is important that you know the potential safety hazards that exist when working with
computer elements and how to address them. It is imperative that you understand such
issues as **material safety data sheets (MSDSs)** and know how to reference them when
needed. Any type of chemical, equipment, or supply that has the potential to harm the
environment or people has to have an MSDS associated with it. These are traditionally
created by the manufacturer, and you can obtain them from the manufacturer or from the
Environmental Protection Agency at **www.epa.gov**.

These sheets are not intended for consumer use but are aimed at emergency workers
and employees who are exposed to the risks of the particular product. Among the information
they include are such things as boiling point, melting point, flash point, and potential
health risks. They also cover storage and disposal recommendations and the procedures to
follow in the case of a spill or leak.

Temperature, humidity level awareness, and proper ventilation

Three items closely related to an environmentally friendly computing environment are temperature,
humidity, and ventilation. We will cover the most important elements with all
three.

Temperature Heat and computers don't mix well. Many computer systems require both
temperature and humidity control for reliable service. The larger servers, communications
equipment, and drive arrays generate considerable amounts of heat; this is especially true of
mainframe and older minicomputers. An environmental system for this type of equipment
is a significant expense beyond the actual computer system costs. Fortunately, newer systems
operate in a wider temperature range. Most new systems are designed to operate in an
office environment.

If the computer systems you're responsible for require special environmental considerations,
you'll need to establish cooling and humidity control. Ideally, systems are located in the
middle of the building, and they're ducted separately from the rest of the **heating, ventilation,
and air conditioning (HVAC)** system. It's a common practice for modern buildings to
use a zone-based air conditioning environment, which allows the environmental plant to be
turned off when the building isn't occupied. A computer room will typically require fulltime
environmental control.

**Humidity Level** Another preventive measure you can take is to maintain the relative
humidity at around 50 percent. Be careful not to increase the humidity too far—to the
point where moisture starts to condense on the equipment! It is a balancing act keeping
humidity at the right level since low humidity causes ESD and high humidity causes moisture
condensation. Both extremes are bad but have completely different effects.

Also, use antistatic spray, which is available commercially, to reduce static buildup on
clothing and carpets. In a pinch, a solution of diluted fabric softener sprayed on these items
will do the same thing.

At the least, you can be mindful of the dangers of ESD and take steps to reduce its effects.
Beyond that, you should educate yourself about those effects so you know when ESD is
becoming a major problem.

**Ventilation Rounding** out temperature and humidity is ventilation. It is important that
air—clean air—circulate around computer equipment to keep it cool and functioning properly.
Server rooms require much more attention to ventilation than office spaces but are the
subject of other exams (Server+, for example) and not test fodder for A+.

What is test fodder is the topic of ventilation within the computer itself—an inadequate flow
of internal air within a computer is a common cause of overheating. To prevent this, know
that all slot covers should remain in place and be replaced if a card is removed from the
system. Know as well that internal fans should be periodically cleaned to ensure proper air
flow. A missing slot cover or malfunctioning fan can lead to inadequate flow of internal air.

**Power surges, brownouts, and blackouts**
A number of power-related threats can harm computers. For more information, see the section
"UPS" earlier in this chapter.

## Battery backup
Battery backups were covered in the section "UPS" earlier in this chapter.

## Surge suppressor
Surge suppressors were covered in the section "UPS" earlier in this chapter.
Protection from airborne particles
Computers don't do well with airborne particles. To protect them from such, you can use
enclosures for your sensitive equipment and air filters to condition the air.

# Enclosures
Enclosures can be considered the first line of defense against particulates. Enclosures are
available that can filter the air, keep air out, and so on. Make certain that the enclosure you
turn to for a solution still offers the necessary ventilation needed to prevent overheating.

# Air filters
Most enclosures incorporate an air filter to clean the air before allowing it to enter. An
analogy to think of is the air filter on a car, which keeps dirt, dust, bugs, and other things
from the intake. When working with air filters, make certain they are kept clean and are
changed per the manufacturer's requirements.

# Dust and debris
One of the most harmful atmospheric hazards to a computer is dust. Dust, dirt, hair, and
other airborne contaminants can get pulled into computers and build up inside. Because
computer fans work by pulling air through the computer (usually sucking it in through the
case and then pushing it out the power supply), it's easy for these items to enter and then
become stuck. Every item in the computer builds up heat, and these particles are no exception.
As they build up, they hinder the fan's ability to perform its function, and the components
get hotter than they would otherwise. Figure 9.8 shows the inside of a system in use
for only six months in an area with carpeting and other dusty surroundings.


Dust builds up inside the system.

# Compressed air
You can remove dust and debris from inside computers with compressed air blown in
short bursts. The short bursts are useful in preventing the dust from flying too far out and
entering another machine, as well as in preventing the can from releasing the air in liquid
form. Compressed air cans should be held 2–3 inches from the system and always used
upright so the content is released as a gas. If the can becomes cold to the touch, discontinue
using it until it heats back to room temperature.

It's possible to use an air compressor instead of compressed-air cans when
you need a lot of air. If you take this approach, make sure you keep the
pounds per square inch (PSI) at or below 40, and include measures on the
air compressor to remove moisture.

# Vacuums
Dust can build up not just within the computer but also in crevices on the outside.
Figure 9.9 shows USB ports on the back of a system that have become a haven for small
dust particles. These ports need to be blown out with compressed air, or cleaned with an
electronic vacuum , before being used, or degradation with the device connected to them
could occur.

Dust collects in unused ports as well.

# Compliance to government regulations
As careful as you try to be, there is always the possibility for accidents to occur. Accidents
can be environment-related (for example, a flash flood no one could predict suddenly overtakes
the server room and shorts out the wiring) or caused by humans (someone mixes the
wrong cleaning chemicals together to try to make their own concoction). Regardless of the
cause or circumstances, one thing is written in stone: You must fully and truthfully document
the problem.

That documentation must be seen by internal parties (managers, human resources,
and so on), and it may also need to be seen by external parties. The latter depends on the
type of industry you are in and the type of incident that occurred. 

For example, if a large
amount of battery acid is spilled on the ground, you should contact the Environmental
Protection Agency (see reporting procedures at www.epa.gov ). Always understand any hazards
that come with the industry you work in and make sure that the proper reporting procedures
are followed or OSHA, EPA, or other governmental entity may fi ne the company.
