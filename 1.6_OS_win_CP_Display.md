# Display / Display Settings

## Display or Display Settings can be found by right-clicking the desktop and selecting Display Settings.

## Resolution

The resolution settings vary based on the OS, but when you need to set the resolution, this
is the place to do it. The documentation that comes with the computer will prescribe a
Recommended setting that you should not exceed.


## Color depth
Color depth is either the number of bits used to indicate the color of a single pixel, in a bitmapped
image or video frame buffer, or the number of bits used for each color component
of a single pixel. In Windows 7, this can be set on the Monitor tab of the properties of the
adapter, as shown in Figure

In Windows 8, 8.1 and Windows 10, color depth, resolution, and refresh rate are all
the same drop-down box and are found after clicking the List All Modes button on the
Adapter tab of the display, as shown in Figure

## Refresh rate
The refresh rate is the number of times in a second that a display updates its buffer and is
expressed in hertz. In Windows 7, the refresh rate is set using a drop-down box just above
the setting for color depth. In Windows 8, 8.1, and 10, the setting is
located as described in the previous section, "Color depth."
