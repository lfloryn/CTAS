# Home vs. Work vs. Public network settings

In Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10 when you make a new connection, you are asked to identify
whether it is a home network, work network, or public network.

If you choose one of the
first two, network discovery is on by default, allowing you to see other computers and
other computers to see you. 

If you choose Public, network discovery is turned off.
Network discovery, when enabled, is a security issue, and this function should not be
used on untrusted networks.


In Figure, you can see that the device is connected to a public network.
