# Implement appropriate data destruction and disposal methods.
### Index 

Think of all the sensitive data written to a hard drive. The drive can contain information
about students, clients, users—anyone and anything. That hard drive can be in a
desktop PC, a laptop, or even a printer (many laser printers above consumer grade offer
the ability to add a hard drive to store print jobs). If it falls into the wrong hands, you
can lose valuable data and also risk a lawsuit for not properly protecting privacy. An
appropriate data destruction/disposal plan should be in place to avoid any potential
problems.

Since data on media holds great value and liability, that media should never be simply
tossed away for prying eyes to stumble upon. For the purposes of this objective, I'll talk
about hard drives, and there are three key concepts to understand in regard to them:
formatting, sanitation, and destruction. Formatting prepares the drive to hold new
information (which can include copying over data already there). 

Sanitation involves
wiping the data on the drive, whereas destruction renders the drive no longer usable. The
subobjectives covered in this section include the following:

- [Physical destruction](#Physical_destruction)
- [Recycling or repurposing best practices](#Recycling_or_repurposing_best_practices)

![note](/img/note.jpg)
While this objective is focused on hard drives, data can also be stored on
portable flash drives, backup tapes, CDs, or DVDs. In the interest of security,
I recommend that you destroy any of them before disposing of them
as well.

# Physical_destruction

Physically destroying the drive involves rendering the component no longer usable. While
the focus is on hard drives, you can also physically destroy other forms of media, such as
flash drives and CD/DVDs.

## Shredder

Many commercial paper shredders include the ability to destroy DVDs and CDs. Paper
shredders, however, are not able to handle hard drives; and you need a shredder created for
just such a purpose. Jackhammer makes a low-volume model that will destroy eight drives
per minute and carries a suggested list price of just under $30,000.

## Drill/hammer
If you don't have the budget for a hard drive shredder, you can accomplish similar results in
a much more time-consuming way with a power drill. The goal is to physically destroy the
platters in the drive.

 Start the process by removing the cover from the drive—this is normally
done with a Torx driver (while #8 does not work with all, it is a good one to try fi rst).
You can remove the arm with a slotted screwdriver and then the cover over the platters
using a Torx driver. 

Don't worry about damaging or scratching anything because nothing is
intended to be saved. Everything but the platters can be tossed away.

As an optional step, you can completely remove the tracks using a belt sander, grinder,
or palm sander. The goal is to turn the shiny surface into fi ne powder. This adds one more
layer of assurance that nothing usable remains. 

Always be careful to wear eye protection
and not breathe in any fi ne particles that you generate during the grinding/destruction
process.

Following this, use the power drill to create the smallest particles possible. A drill press
works much better for this task than trying to hold the drive and drill it with a handheld
model. 

Finally you can use a hammer to destroy the platters as well; it provides a certain
level of satisfaction if the drive died and you had to restore it from backup.

Even with practice, you will find that manually destroying a hard drive is
time-consuming. There are companies that specialize in this and can do it
efficiently. One such company is Shred-it, which will pick it up from you
and provide a chain-of-custody assurance and a certificate of destruction
upon completion. You can find out more about what it offers here:

# Electromagnetic/degaussing
Degaussing involves applying a strong magnetic fi eld to initialize the media (this is also
referred to as disk wiping ). This process helps ensure that information doesn't fall into the
wrong hands.

Since degaussing uses a specifi cally designed electromagnet to eliminate all data on
the drive, that destruction also includes the factory prerecorded servo tracks. You can
find wand model degaussers priced at just over $500 or desktop units that sell for up to
$30,000.

# Incineration
A fi nal option that exists for some forms of storage is to burn the media. Regardless of
whether the media is a hard drive, CD, DVD, solid-state drive, or floppy disk, the media
must be reduced to ash, or in the case of hard drive platters, the internal platters must be
physically deformed using heat.

# Certificate of destruction

Certifi cates of destruction are documents that attest to either the physical destruction of the
media on which sensitive data was located or a scientifi cally approved method of removing
the data from a drive. Later in this chapter, you will be introduced to some methods of
removal, both approved and unapproved.

These certificates are typically issued to the organization by a storage vendor or cloud
provider to prove either that the data has been removed or that the media has been
destroyed.

# Recycling_or_repurposing_best_practices

Multiple levels of reformatting can be done to remove the contents of a drive. A standard
format—accomplished using the operating system's format utility (or similar)—can mark
space occupied by files as available for new files without truly deleting what was there. 

Such
erasing—if you want to call it that—doesn't guarantee that the information isn't still on the
disk and recoverable.

# Low-level format vs. standard format

A low-level format (typically accomplished only in the factory) can be performed on the
system, or a utility can be used to completely wipe the disk clean. This process helps ensure
that information doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

IDE hard drives are low-level formatted by the manufacturer. Low-level formatting must
be performed even before a drive can be partitioned. In low-level formatting, the drive controller
chip and the drive meet for the fi rst time and learn to work together. 

Because IDE
drives have their controllers integrated into the drive, low-level formatting is a factory process
with these drives and does not depend on the operating system.

![warning](/img/warning.jpg)
**Never low-level format IDE or SCSI drives! They're low-level formatted
from the factory, and you may cause problems by using low-level utilities
on these types of drives.**

The main thing to remember for the exams is that most forms of formatting included
with the operating system do not actually completely erase the data. Formatting the drive
and then disposing of it has caused many companies problems when the data has been
retrieved by individuals who never should have seen it using applications that are commercially
available.

# Overwrite
Overwriting the drive entails copying over the data with new data. A common practice is
to replace the data with 0s. 

A number of applications allow you to recover what was there
prior to the last write operation, and for that reason, most overwrite software will write the
same sequence and save it multiple times.

# Drive wipe
If it's possible to verify beyond a reasonable doubt that a piece of hardware that's no longer
being used doesn't contain any data of a sensitive or proprietary nature, that hardware can
be recycled (sold to employees, sold to a third party, donated to a school, and so on). That
level of assurance can come from wiping a hard drive or using specialized utilities.

If you can't be assured that the hardware in question doesn't contain important data, the
hardware should be destroyed. You cannot, and should not, take a risk that the data your
company depends on could fall into the wrong hands.

**Degaussing hard drives is difficult and may render the drive unusable.**
