# Summarize the importance of physical security measures.

Physical security is a grab bag of elements that can be added to an environment to aid in securing it. It ranges from key fobs to retinal scanners. In this section, you will examine the physical security components as listed by CompTIA. Topics covered in this section include
the following:

- [Mantrap](#Mantrap)
- [Badge reader](#Badge_reader)
- [Smart card](#Smart_card)
- [Security guard](#Security_guard)
- [Door lock](#Door_lock)
- [Biometric locks](#Biometric_locks)
- [Hardware tokens](#Hardware_tokens)
- [Cable locks](#Cable_locks)
- [Server locks](#Server_locks)
- [USB locks](#USB_locks)
- [Privacy screen](#Privacy_screen)
- [Key fobs](#Key_fobs)
- [Entry control roster](#Entry_control_roster)

# Mantrap 

A mantrap is a series of two doors with a small room between them. 

The user is authenticated
at the first door and then allowed into the room. 

At that point, additional verification
will occur (such as a guard visually identifying the person), and then they are allowed
through the second door. These doors are normally used only in high-security situations.
Mantraps also typically require that the first door is closed, prior to enabling the second
door to open. Figure  shows a mantrap design.

# Badge_reader

Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a wireless, no-contact technology used with
badges or cards and their accompanying reader. The reader is connected to the workstation
and validates against the security system. 

This increases the security of the authentication
process because the user must be in physical possession of the smart card to use the
resources. Of course, if the card is lost or stolen, the person who finds the card can access
the resources it allows. 

Badge readers are used not only to provide access to devices but also
to provide access to doors as well.

# Smart_card

A smart card is a type of badge or card that gives you access to resources, including
buildings, parking lots, and computers. It contains information about your identity and
access privileges. Each area or computer has a card scanner or a reader in which you
insert your card.

Smart cards are difficult to counterfeit, but they're easy to steal. Once a thief has a smart
card, that person has all the access the card allows. To prevent this, many organizations
don't put any identifying marks on their smart cards, making it harder for someone to
utilize them. Many modern smart cards require a password or PIN to activate the card, and
they employ encryption to protect the card's contents.

# Security_guard

While many other less manual methods of monitoring are available, nothing takes the place
of a human being. Security guards can exercise judgment and common sense (sometimes an
automated system seems to lack that) as they encounter issues.

# Door_lock

One of the easiest ways to prevent people intent on creating problems from physically entering
your environment is to lock your doors and keep them out.

Door locks are the most universal form of physical barriers , which are a key aspect of
access control. The objective of a physical barrier is to prevent access to computers and
network systems. The most effective physical barrier implementations require that more
than one physical barrier be crossed to gain access. This type of approach is called a
multiple-barrier system .

Ideally, your systems should have a minimum of three physical barriers.

 The first barrier
is the external entrance to the building, referred to as a perimeter , which is protected by
burglar alarms, external walls, fencing , surveillance, and so on. An access list should exist
to specifi cally identify who can enter and be verifi ed by a guard or someone in authority.

The second barrier is the entrance into the building and could rely on such items as ID
badges to gain access. The third barrier is the entrance to the computer room itself (and
could require fobs, or keys). Each of these entrances can be individually secured, monitored,
and protected with alarm systems.

Think of the three barriers this way:

- outer (the fence),
- middle (guards,locks, and mantraps)
- inner (key fobs).

Although these three barriers won't always stop intruders, they will potentially slow
them down enough that law enforcement can respond before an intrusion is fully developed.
Once inside, a truly secure site should be dependent on a physical token for access to
the actual network resources.

# Biometric_locks
Biometric devices use physical characteristics to identify the user. Such devices are becoming
more common in the business environment. Biometric systems include hand scanners,
retinal scanners, and, possibly soon, DNA scanners. To gain access to resources, you must
pass a physical screening process. In the case of a hand scanner, this may include identifying
fi ngerprints, scars, and markings on your hand. Retinal scanners compare your eye's
retinal pattern to a stored retinal pattern to verify your identity. DNA scanners will examine
a unique portion of your DNA structure to verify that you are who you say you are.

With the passing of time, the definition of biometric is expanding from simply identifying
physical attributes about a person to being able to describe patterns in their behavior.

Recent advances have been made in the ability to authenticate someone based on the key
pattern they use when entering their password (how long they pause between each key,
the amount of time each key is held down, and so forth). A company adopting biometric
technologies needs to consider the controversy they may face (some authentication methods
are considered more intrusive than others). It also needs to consider the error rate and that
errors can include both false positives and false negatives.

Biometric systems, like most security tools, make mistakes. When the system improperly
allows an individual in who should not be, it is called a false acceptance and the rate
at which this occurs is called the false acceptance rate(FAR). When the system improperly
rejects a legitimate user, it is called a false rejection, and the rate at which these occur is
called the false rejection rate(FRR).

# Hardware_tokens
Physical tokens are anything that a user must have on them to access network resources
and are often associated with devices that enable the user to generate a one-time password
authenticating their identity. SecurID, from RSA, is one of the best-known examples of a
physical token; learn more at

# Cable_locks
While not all devices support this, larger mobile devices such as laptops come with a notch
where you can attach a cable lock and lock the device to something solid, as you would
lock a bicycle to a rack. This may even be advisable on some desktop systems if those systems
are vulnerable to theft and contain sensitive data. Users who carry company devices
that support cable locks should be instructed to never leave the device unattended and, if
necessary, lock the device to an immovable object.

# Server_locks
Both rack and nonrack server systems can come with physical locks that prevent tampering
with the server if physical access becomes possible. Having said that, all servers should be
locked in a room, but the inclusion of physical server locks as well is an example of defense
in depth.

# USB_locks
USB locks plug into the USB port. The lock prevents removal of the device, thus preventing
use of the USB port.

# Privacy_screen
Privacy filters are either film or glass add-ons that are placed over a monitor and prevent
the data on the screen from being readable when viewed from the sides. Only the user sitting
directly in front of the screen is able to read the data. This is a good mitigation to
shoulder surfing.

# Key_fobs
Key fobs are named after the chains used to hold pocket watches to clothes. They are security
devices that you carry with you that display a randomly generated code that you can
then use for authentication. This code usually changes quickly (every 60 seconds is probably
the average), and you combine the code with your PIN for authentication.

# Entry_control_roster

At any physical location where users are arriving and departing the facility, users should be
authenticated through one of the mechanisms discussed in this section. There should be a
recording of each user arriving and departing.

 This can be either a record of all successful
and unsuccessful authentications on a log or, in the case of visitors who have no network
account, a physical identification process of some sort. 

In any case, there should be an entry
control roster in the form of a physical document that shows when each person entered and
left the facility. This will serve as a backup in case the log is lost.
