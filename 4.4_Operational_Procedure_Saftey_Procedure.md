# Explain common safety procedures
### Index 

This objective deals with potential hazards, both to you and to the computer system. 

It
focuses on protecting humans from harm due to electricity and on protecting computer
components from harm due to electrostatic discharge. 

**The subobjectives included in this section are as follows:**

- [Proper component handling and storage](#Proper_component_handling_and_storage)
- [Toxic waste handling](#Toxic_waste_handling)
- [Personal safety](#Personal_safety)

# Equipment_grounding

**Electrostatic discharge (ESD)** is one of the most dangerous risks associated with working
with computers.

Not only does ESD have the potential to damage components of the computer, but it can also injure you. 

Failing to understand the proper way to avoid it could cause you great harm.

**ESD** is the technical term for what happens whenever two objects of dissimilar charge
come in contact—think of rubbing your feet on a carpet and then touching a light switch.

The two objects exchange electrons to equalize the electrostatic charge between them. If
the device receiving the charge happens to be an electronic component, there is a good
chance it can be damaged.

The likelihood that a component will be damaged increases with the use of **complementary
metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)** chips because these chips contain a thin metaloxide
layer that is hypersensitive to ESD. 

The previous generation's **transistor–transistor 
logic (TTL)** chips are more robust than the CMOS chips because they don't contain this
metal-oxide layer. 

Most of today's integrated circuits (ICs) are CMOS chips, so ESD is
more of a concern lately.

The lowest static voltage transfer that you can feel is around 3,000 volts (it doesn't electrocute
you because there is extremely little current).

A static transfer that you can see is
at least 10,000 volts! Just by sitting in a chair, you can generate around 100 volts of static
electricity. 

Walking around wearing synthetic materials can generate around 1,000 volts.
You can easily generate around 20,000 volts simply by dragging your smooth-soled shoes
across a carpet in the winter.

 (Actually, it doesn't have to be winter to run this danger; it
can occur in any room with very low humidity. It's just that heated rooms in wintertime
generally have very low humidity.)

It would make sense that these thousands of volts would damage computer components.
However, a component can be damaged with as little as 80 volts. 

That means if your body
has a small charge built up in it, you could damage a component without even realizing it.

Just as you can ground yourself by using a grounding strap, you can ground equipment.
This is most often accomplished by using a mat or a connection directly to a ground.

# Proper_component_handling_and_storage
When handling computer components, such as motherboards, network cards, and such,
it is easy to damage the delicate circuitry with the static electricity that builds up in your
body in certain environments. 

In this section, we'll talk about how you can protect these
components and how you should store them when not in use.

## Antistatic bags
When working with components and when storing them, it is a good idea to store them
in antistatic bags. Although you can buy these bags, replacement parts usually come in
antistatic bags, and if you keep these bags, you can use them later. 

These bags also can
serve as a safe place to lay a component temporarily while working on a device.

## ESD straps
There are measures you can implement to help contain the effects of ESD. The easiest one
to implement is the antistatic wrist strap , also referred to as an ESD strap .

You attach one
end of the ESD strap to an earth ground (typically the ground pin on an extension cord),
or to the metal case, and wrap the other end around your wrist. This strap grounds your
body and keeps it at a zero charge. Figure shows the proper way to attach an antistatic strap.

**Proper ESD strap connection**

If you do not have a grounded outlet available, you can achieve partial benefit simply by
attaching the strap to the metal frame of the PC case. Doing so keeps the charge equalized
between your body and the case so that there is no electrostatic discharge when you touch
components inside the case.

![safe](/img/warning.jpg)
An ESD strap is a specially designed device to bleed electrical charges
away safely . It uses a 1 megaohm resistor to bleed the charge away slowly.
A simple wire wrapped around your wrist will not work correctly and could
electrocute you!

![safe](/img/warning.jpg)
Do not wear the antistatic wrist strap when there is the potential to
encounter a high-voltage capacitor, such as when working on the inside of
a monitor or power supply. The strap could channel that voltage through
your body.

## ESD mats
It is possible to damage a device simply by laying it on a bench top. For this reason,
you should have an ESD mat (also known as an antistatic mat ) in addition to an ESD
strap. This mat drains excess charge away from any item coming in contact with it
(see Figure ). ESD mats are also sold as mouse/keyboard pads to prevent ESD charges
from interfering with the operation of the computer.

![safe](/img/f4.3_OP_Saftey_2.jpg)

You can also purchase ESD floor mats for technicians to stand on while performing
computer maintenance. These include a grounding cord, usually 6 to 10 feet in length.

Vendors have methods of protecting components in transit from manufacture to installation.
They press the pins of ICs into antistatic foam to keep all the pins at the same potential,
and circuit boards are shipped in antistatic bags, discussed earlier. However, keep
in mind that unlike antistatic mats, antistatic bags do not drain the charges away—they
should never be used in place of antistatic mats.

## Self-grounding
Grounding is the electrical term for providing a path for an electrical charge to follow to
return to earth. This term was mentioned earlier as it relates to ESD straps and mats, but
it is the element of those that saves you from harm in the event of an electrical discharge—
the charge passes to ground. The easiest way to ground yourself is to use a grounding
strap.

# Toxic_waste_handling

Many of the components in a computer should not simply be thrown in the trash because
they contain toxic materials. In this section, you'll learn about proper handling and disposal
of these components and materials.

## Batteries
Batteries can contain a number of compounds and materials that should not make their
way into landfills. 

The following are some examples:
- Rare earth metals
- Lead
- Cadmium
- Lithium
- Alkaline manganese
- Mercury

You should make battery recycling a standard procedure and follow local regulations for
battery disposal when the time comes to dispose of the batteries.

## Toner
Toner cartridges are another item that should not be thrown away. They should be recycled.
Moreover, in any case where toner has been spilled you should clean up with a special vacuum
made for that purpose. If you use a regular vacuum, the metal toner will damage the vacuum.

## CRT
While most CRT monitors have been disposed of already, you may find yourself with a
number of them that you need to get rid of. These cannot be thrown in the trash. The contents
of the device are under pressure, and if something breaks the glass screen, there will
be glass and other materials sprayed out with a force that could injure someone.

The monitor uses a lot of power as it directs electrons on the screen via a strong magnet.
The electrons and magnet require a considerable amount of voltage to be able to do their
task. Like power supplies, monitors have the ability to hold their charge a long time after
the power has been disconnected.

You should never open a power supply or a monitor for the reasons discussed here. The
risk of electrocution with these two devices is significant.

If you are not sure whether electricity is present, or its voltage, use a voltmeter.

## Cell phones
Cell phones should not be thrown away, as they contain many of the same compounds
found in laptops and desktops. Since the majority of the time the device is still perfectly
functional (the user simply wanted a new phone), it should be sold or donated so that someone
else can make use of the phone.

## Tablets
Treat tablets in the same way you would cell phones and either sell, recycle, or donate.

# Personal_safety

There is nothing on a computer, a server, a router, and so on, that cannot be replaced or
repaired. The same, however, is not true for you. It is imperative that you protect yourself
from harm and follow safety procedures when working with computers.

## Disconnect power before repairing PC
You should never attempt to remove a case, open a case, or work on any element that is
carrying electricity without first disconnecting it. If removing power to the device you are
working on is more complicated than just unplugging it (requiring circuit breakers to be
thrown, fuses to be removed, and so forth), then use a voltmeter to make sure the current is
off at the device before proceeding.

## Remove jewelry
Gold and other metals are great conductors of electrical current. The last thing you want
while working on a problem is for the gold chain around your neck to fall against a capacitor.
Take it off. While not all jewelry is metallic, all jewelry is a snagging hazard.

## Lifting techniques
An easy way to get hurt is by moving equipment in an unsafe or improper way. 

**Here are some safe lifting techniques to always keep in mind:**

- Lift with your legs, not your back. When you have to pick something up, bend at the knees, not at the waist. You want to maintain the natural curve of the back and spine when lifting.
- Be careful to not twist when lifting. Keep the weight on your centerline.
- Keep objects as close to your body as possible and at waist level.
- Where possible, push instead of pull.

The goal in lifting should be to reduce the strain on lower back muscles as much as possible, since muscles in the lower back aren't nearly as strong as those in the legs or other parts of the body. Some people use a back belt or brace to help maintain the proper position
while lifting.

## Weight limitations
Closely related to lifting and moving equipment is the topic of weight limitations. If you believe the load is too much for you to carry, don't try to pick it up. Get help!

When possible, use a cart and always be aware of the environment. While you may be 
able to carry 80 pounds on a level surface without trouble, that amount will lessen if there
are stairs, uneven floors, or narrow doorways. Map out the path you are going to take
before you begin lifting and moving items.

## Electrical fire safety
Repairing a computer is not often the cause of an electrical fire. However, you should know
how to extinguish such a fire properly. 

Three major classes of fire extinguishers are available, one for each type of flammable substance: 

- A for wood and paper fires, 
- B for flammable liquids, and 
- C for electrical fires. 

The most popular type of fire extinguisher today is the multipurpose, or ABC-rated, extinguisher. 

It contains a dry chemical powder that smothers 
the fire and cools it at the same time. For electrical fires (which may be related to a shortedout
wire in a power supply), make sure the fire extinguisher will work for class C fires. If
you don't have an extinguisher that is specifically rated for electrical fires (type C), you can
use an ABC-rated extinguisher.

## Cable management
It can be time-consuming to tie up cables, run them in channels, and snake them through
walls, but it is time well spent when it keeps one person from harm. It is all too easy to get
tangled in a cable or trip over one that is run across the floor. Exposed cables should be
routed properly and covered using cable-throughs and pass-throughs to reduce the likelihood
of tripping as well as damage to the cables themselves.

Take the extra time to manage cables, and it will increase your safety as well as that of
others who work in that environment.

## Safety goggles
In any environment where you may get dust or harmful materials in your eyes, you should
wear safety goggles. For example, when working in a dusty shop area where a computer
is located, this might be advisable. Another example might be when you are cleaning up
printer toner.

There are also safety glasses that can be used when spending long hours staring at a
computer screen that will reduce the eye strain that comes with this type of activity.

## Air filter mask
While safety goggles will protect your eyes from dust and other harmful particulates, they
will do nothing to protect your lungs. Air filter masks should always be available, and technicians
should be encouraged to wear them in any situation where safety goggles are called
for or in any scenario where you have reason to believe that the surrounding air may contain
harmful compounds.

# Compliance_with_local_government_regulations

It is your responsibility, as an administrator and a professional, to know (or learn) the regulations
that exist for dealing with safety. 

You should know them from the local level to the
federal level and be familiar with the reporting procedures for incidents you are faced with.

For more information, see the section "**Regulatory and compliance policy**" earlier in this
chapter.
