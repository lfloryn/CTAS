# Troubleshoot and resolve PC security issues
### Index 

System issues in many cases have security breaches at the root of the cause. It has become
almost a given that any problem that cannot be traced to any other cause should be
attacked by first scanning for viruses and malware. This section discusses common symptoms
of security-related failures and tools that can be used to mitigate the damage. 

**Thecommon symptoms addressed in objective 3.2 include the following:**

## Common symptoms
Systems can display many symptoms when something is amiss. Not all are malware related,
but crazy things start to happen when malware is introduced to a computer. This section
discusses some of the strange behaviors of computers that are infected as well as issues
unrelated to malware.

Many viruses will announce that your system is infected as soon as they gain access to it.
They may take control of your system, fl ash annoying messages on your screen, or destroy
your hard disk. When this occurs, you'll know that you're a victim. Other viruses will
cause your system to slow down, cause fi les to disappear from your computer, or take over
your drive space. The Windows Defender Security Center can show you what security measures
are set on your system

# Pop-ups
Although relatively benign when compared with malware in general, pop-ups are annoying
to users. They also use system resources as they open and in some cases can introduce additional
malware when they open.

Fortunately, most browsers now contain pop-up blockers that can prevent unwanted
pop-ups. 

In some cases, users want pop-ups to be allowed—in fact, some website functions
fail when a pop-up blocker is enabled. For that reason, users can use the Pop-Up Blocker
Settings of Internet Explorer to allow pop-ups for certain websites, as shown in Figure.

Other browsers usually have a similar setting.

# Browser_redirection

A browser redirection is one of the most serious security problems. Browser hijacking software
is external code that changes your Internet Explorer settings. It may include changing
your home page or adding or removing items from your favorites. Some sites will be added
that point to dubious content. 

In most cases, the home page will revert to the unwanted
destination even if you change it manually because the hijacker made Registry changes to
your system. To prevent this from occurring, remember these tips:

- Avoid suspect sites.
- Use and update an antivirus program regularly.
- Tighten your browser security settings.

Once you are a victim, you may have to apply antivirus software from an external
source.

# Security_alerts
Sometimes you can tell by security warnings that the site you are on is attempting to attack
your computer. 

This is true if you have a personal firewall such as Windows Firewall. It can
also occur when you have the phishing filter enabled in Internet Explorer. 

You will know
when the system asks you whether you want to allow access to your machine from the site.
Unless you initiated a download, don't allow it.

Users have plenty of real viruses and other issues to worry about, yet some people fi nd it
entertaining to issue phony threats disguised as security alerts to keep people on their toes.
Some of the more popular hoaxes that have been passed around are the Goodtimes and the
Irina viruses. 

Millions of users received emails about these two viruses, and the symptoms
sounded awful. The mention of these two hoaxes serves to outline the most well known
hoaxes. Since these came out, there have been many different hoaxes, most of which were
not as well known as these.

Both of these warnings claimed that the viruses would do things that are impossible to
accomplish with a virus. When you receive a virus warning, you can verify its authenticity
by looking on the website of the antivirus software you use, or you can go to several public
systems. One of the more helpful sites to visit to get the status of the latest viruses is that of
the CERT organization ( **www.cert.org**).

CERT monitors and tracks viruses and provides regular reports on this site.

 When you receive an email that you suspect is a hoax , check the CERT site before forwarding
the message to anyone else. 

The creator of the hoax wants to create widespread
panic, and if you blindly forward the message to co-workers and acquaintances, you're
helping the creator accomplish this task. For example, any email that includes "forward
to all your friends" is a candidate for research. 

Disregarding the hoax allows it to die a
quick death and keeps users focused on productive tasks. Any concept that spreads quickly
through the Internet is referred to as a meme .

# Slow_performance

A reduction in performance is one of the classic signs of malware infection. When no other
reason can be isolated for the slowing of a system, scanning for malware is always recommended.
All types of malware eat up significant system resources, starving the normal processes
of the computer of the power they need.

# Internet_connectivity_issues

Some malware will affect your Internet access. It may block you from accessing certain
sites, or it may allow access to only a small number of sites. It has been reported that viral
programs block access for certain programs and browsers while still allowing others to
function. When access is denied, a message like the following is generated:


```dos
Unable to connect to HTTP Proxy. Your proxy may be misconfigured or offline. -336
```

Moreover, this occurred even after the virus was supposedly cleaned from the system.

# PC/OS_lockup

It is quite common for the system to lock up when malware is attacking. You may notice
when this occurs that the hard drive is very busy, although nothing appears to be going on.
In some cases, you can use Task Manager to end the process that is locking everything up,
and in other cases you simply must shut down the computer to break out of the lockup.

# Application_crash

Another possible symptom of a malware infection is the crashing of applications. While
this will occur from time to time for other reasons, when it is occurring repeatedly, you
should suspect malware. When the application that is crashing is your antivirus software,
this is an even stronger indication of malware because disabling or damaging your antivirus
protection is the first thing that some types of malware attempt to do.

# OS_updates_failures
Malware may take certain measures to protect itself. One of these is to block you from
accessing operating system update sites like Windows Update. You never notice this
because these updates can be set to run automatically, so when they fail, it may not be
obvious that they did.

Another action the malware can take along the same lines is to disable your antivirus
software. For this reason, any time your antivirus program notifies you that it is not functional
or cannot update itself, you should consider this possibility and get it back up and
running (if you can) as soon as possible.

# Rogue_antivirus
If you receive messages (again usually at a suspect website) warning you that your system is
infected, it will also usually offer to clean the system. At a minimum, they are trying to sell
you anti-malware software through the bogus warning.

Worse, though, is that executing the "cleaning" sometimes results in the introduction
of malware to the system—which was the whole point of the message to begin with. In
general, pay no attention to these messages and try to close them and exit the website that
generated them as quickly as possible.

# Spam
A sudden increase in spam may indicate that adware has been installed on the machine.
This type of malware monitors your activities so that it can more accurately target spam
email. This is not particularly dangerous, but you have to wonder—if that malware got on
your system, what else might lurk on your computer?

[Top](#Index)

# Renamed_system_files
Many viruses will rename system files and adopt the name of the system file. This can help
the virus escape detection when scanning occurs since most virus definitions identify the
virus by the name of the file that introduced the virus. This renaming of the system file can
cause big problems when the file is required and the virus file is incapable of providing the
required functionality.

[Top](#Index)

# Disappearing_files
Another symptom of a viral infection is the deletion of files in the system. Many viruses
delete key files in your system to render it inoperable. This could be one of the ways it
renders any existing antivirus programs inoperable. It also can be part of disabling Internet
access either completely or selectively.

# File_permission_changes
If the malware is a rootkit or Trojan horse, it can change permissions to key files. The permissions
would then allow access to remote systems. This can help to enhance the functionality
of backdoors, which allow the computer to be controlled remotely.

[Top](#Index)

# Hijacked_email
Viruses can also make changes to the email client that send a copy of all emails to another
system. Depending on the content of email, this can make the user open to identity theft
and can also be used in corporate espionage. 

It is especially harmful if the account is an IT
administrator passing key enterprise security details through email.

The following are examples of evidence of email hijacking:

- Responses to email never sent by the user
- Automated replies from unknown people

# Access_denied
This can be a symptom of file permission changes. It can also be a message you get when
you try to access the Internet in general or try to access specific sites such as those used for
security updates and antivirus definitions.

# Invalid_certificate_(trusted_root_CA)

When you are bombarded with certificate error messages at every website you visit, it's
another sign of malware. Some types of malware interface with the certificate authentication
process.

Certificate errors can happen for a multitude of reasons. The most common reason
is that your operating system's time or date is off and should be adjusted. When you
check this, make sure to verify that you are in the right time zone. 

If your operating
system time and date are correct, then you should suspect another problem—usually
a security-related problem with the site you are trying to visit. Proceed with
caution, especially if you are entering credentials, personal information, or banking
information.

# System/application log errors
If any of the symptoms mentioned here leave you with the suspicion you may have a malware
infection, another place to look for clues is the operating system log or the application
log (especially if you are having an issue with an application and you suspect malware).

Event Viewer (eventvwr.exe) can show a lot of detailed information about what is running
on your operating system.

![TR_PC_Sec](/img/f3.2_Software_TR_PC_Sec_5.jpg)



Although you might think that all the security-related information is in the Security
log, you're only half right. The Security log is used by the Security Reference Monitor
inside of the Executive kernel. It is responsible for reporting object audit attempts.
Examples of object audit attempts include file access, group membership, and
password changes.

Most of the useful security-related information will be in the Application and System
logs. From these logs, you can see errors and warnings that will alert you to potential
security-related problems. 

When you suspect an issue with the operating system or an
application that interacts with the operating system, you should check these logs for clues.
The event log won't tell you exactly what is wrong and how to fix it, but it will tell you
there is an issue and that it needs to be investigated closer, as shown in Figure
