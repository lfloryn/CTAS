# configure Microsoft Windows networking on a client/desktop.
CompTIA offers a number of exams and certifications on networking (Network+, Server+,
and so on), but to become A+ certified, you must have good knowledge of basic networking
skills as they relate to the Windows operating system.

It's important to know how network addressing works and the features offered in the
Windows operating systems to simplify configuration. 

CompTIA expects you to have a
broad range of knowledge in this category, including some obscure features (such as QoS).
