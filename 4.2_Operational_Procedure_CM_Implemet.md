# Implement basic change management best practices
### Index 

There is an old saying "too many cooks spoil the broth," and when it comes to managing
networks, it certainly applies. When technicians make changes to the servers that are
not centrally managed and planned, chaos reigns. 

In that environment, changes might be
made that work at cross purposes to one another. All organizations need a change management
process whereby all changes go through a formal evaluation process before they are
implemented.

This process ensures that all changes support the goals of the organization and that the
impact of each change is anticipated before the change is made. 

There should be a change
management board (sometimes called a change control board) to which all changes are submitted
for review. Only when the change has been approved should it be made. 

**This section covers the following topics:**

- [Documented business processes](#Documented_business_processes)
- [Purpose of the change](#Purpose_of_the_change)
- [Scope the change](#Scope_the_change)
- [Risk analysis](#Risk_analysis)
- [Plan for change](#Plan_for_change)
- [End-user acceptance](#End-user_acceptance)
- [Change board](#Change_board)
- [Backout plan](#Backout_plan)
- [Document changes](#Document_changes)


# Documented_business_processes

As organizations grow and develop, they generate business processes they follow.

Sometimes these processes become almost ingrained in users, but over time methods utilized
may "drift" away from the original process. 

For this reason, all key business processes
should be recorded and followed, and any change to such processes must undergo the
change management examination to ensure that it is beneficial to the entire organization
and supports all of its goals.

# Purpose_of_the_change

When any change is suggested, the proposed benefit derived from the change must be identified.

Otherwise, there is no reason for the change. 

During the change management process,
the relative costs and benefits to the overall organization will be weighed by a change
management board or team.

# Scope_the_change

In some cases, a change may be beneficial for some users or groups but not others.

 In
that case, we may limit the change (called scoping) to only those it will benefit. 

While
scoping is not possible with some changes (cases where all must share any changes), it
can be utilized in some specific cases where a change can be segregated to only a set
of users.

# Risk_analysis

Sometimes changes bring risk, and these risks must be identified. 

All changes should
undergo a risk analysis process to identify such risks and any controls or countermeasures
that can be implemented. 

The goal of such countermeasures may be either to reduce the
risk to a level the organization is comfortable with or to eliminate it entirely.

# Plan_for_change

Once a change has been approved, the timing of the change and its implementation must be
carefully planned so as not to disrupt operations. 

Affected parties should be notified of the
change and when it will occur. 

Any disruptions to service must be announced ahead of time
so users can plan for doing without service for the planned period of downtime.

# End-user_acceptance

The change management board (discussed next) should include regular users so any proposed
changes can be assessed for end-user acceptance. 

This can help to avoid widespread user dissatisfaction after the change.

# Change_board

The change management or change control board should contain a cross-section of representatives
from the company. 

In this way each change can be assessed by each stakeholder group in the organization. 

**The process should follow these steps:**

```dos
1. All changes should be formally requested.
2. Each request should be analyzed to ensure that it supports all goals and polices.
3. Prior to formal approval, all costs and effects of the methods of implementation should be reviewed.
```

## Approvals

**After they're approved, the change steps should be developed.**

# Backout_plan

During implementation, incremental testing should occur, relying on a predetermined fallback
strategy if necessary.

[Top](#Index)

# Document_changes

Complete documentation should be produced and submitted with a formal report to management.
