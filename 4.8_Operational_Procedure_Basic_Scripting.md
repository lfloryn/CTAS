# Identify the basics of scripting.
### Index 

Scripts are used to automate anything that can be accomplished at the command line. It
prevents having to manually type in the commands and also allows you to schedule a script
file to run at a certain time. 

Topics covered in this section include the following:

- Script file types
- Environment variables
- Comment syntax
- Basic script constructs
- Basic data types


# Script file types
Script files can come in various file types. In this section we'll look at these file types:

```dos
.bat
Batch file or files with a .bat extension are used to automate a command or set of commands each time you execute the batch file.

.ps1
Files with this extension are used to script tasks in PowerShell, a powerful scripting language used by Microsoft.

.vbs
These are Visual Basic script files. The VBScript scripting language contains code that can be executed within Windows or Internet Explorer via the Windows-based script host.

.sh
Files that contain the .sh file extension are self-extracting files. The SH file contains selected files and a shell script along with instructions on how to extract the contents of the SH file archive.

.pyc
A .pyc file is one written in the Python language. Python runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux/Unix. 

.js
A JS file is a text file containing JavaScript code that is used to execute JavaScript instructions in web pages.

# Environment variables
Environmental variables are default locations for various objects like the TEMP folder,
for example. They are usually set during system startup by the system init script. They
can be altered within a script or command from the default. In Microsoft Windows,
each environment variable's default value is stored in the Windows Registry or set in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file. 

Some examples of environmental variables are as follows:
## Linux/Unix
- $HOME contains the location of the user's home directory.
- $PWD points to the current directory.
## Windows
- %CONFIG holds the symbolic name of the currently chosen boot configuration.
- %TEMP% (and %TMP%) contain the path to the directory where temporary files should be stored.

# Comment syntax
Within a script you can include comments that are intended to be read by people but not to
be processed. These might explain the rationale behind a script or give some historical perspective
to the script. When including one, you indicate that the line is a comment (and not
to be executed) by some sort of character set. For example, any text between // and the end
of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed). In PowerShell V2, <# #> can
be used for block comments.

# Basic script constructs
Within a script there are several tools or techniques you can use to make the script more
efficient. Let's look at two of these tools.

# Basic loops
Loops are used to get a script to go back to an earlier line and execute it again, perhaps with different
data. Looping saves having to write the command over and over again within the script,
once for each data piece. It is accomplished in many ways by different languages. For example,
the following command in Linux/Unix displays the welcome message five times with a for loop:

```dos
#!/bin/bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
echo "Welcome $i times"
done
```

This type of for loop is characterized by counting. The range is specified by a beginning
(#1) and ending number (#5). The for loop executes a sequence of commands for each
member in a list of items. This is a representative example in Bash, one of several shells or
interfaces used to manage Linux.

# Variables
Variables are characters that are placeholders for data. There are two actions you can perform for variables.
- Setting a value
- Reading the value

You can set the value of a variable with a command either outside of or within a script. To
read the variable, place its name (preceded by a $ sign) anywhere in the script you want. Before
the system (Bash in this case) interprets (or runs) every line, it first checks to see whether any
variable names are present. For every variable it has identified, it replaces the variable name
with its value. Then it runs that line of code and begins the process again on the next line.

# Basic data types
When creating scripts, you use two data types.

## Integers
An integer (from the Latin meaning "whole") is a number that can be written without a
fractional component (1, 2, 3 but not 1.5, 1.6).

## Strings
A string is a series of characters that often represents code that is executed and often implemented
as an array data structure of bytes.
