This utility allows you to view and configure various system elements.

From within this
one relatively innocuous panel, you can make a large number of configuration changes to
a Windows machine. 

The different versions of Windows have different options available
in this panel, but they will include some of the following: General, Network Identification,
Device Manager, Hardware, Hardware Profiles, User Profiles, Environment, Startup/
Shutdown, Performance, System Restore, Automatic Updates, Remote, Computer Name,
and Advanced. System is found in Control Panel.


The General tab gives you an overview of the system, such as OS version, registration
information, basic hardware levels (Processor and RAM), and the service pack level that's
installed, if any.

## Performance (virtual memory)

Performance settings are configured on the Advanced tab, as shown in Figure 
Clicking the Settings button allows you to change the visual effects used on the system
and configure Data Execution Prevention (DEP). Data execution prevention is a security
feature that prevents the execution of certain processes in key files. You can also configure
virtual memory on the Advanced tab. Virtual memory is the paging file used by Windows
as RAM.

In most cases you should never change the virtual memory section but in cases where
performance is lagging you can try to dedicate more disk space for this function.

Remote settings
On the Remote tab, as shown in Figure, you can choose whether to allow Remote
Assistance to be enabled.

the most recent automatic restore point.
