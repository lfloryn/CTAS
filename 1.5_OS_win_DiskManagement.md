# Disk Management

In Windows, you can manage your hard drives using the Disk Management tool. To access
Disk Management, access the Control Panel and double-click Administrative Tools. Then
double-click Computer Management. Finally, double-click Disk Management.

The Disk Management screen lets you view a host of information regarding all the drives
installed in your system, including CD-ROM and DVD drives. The list of devices in the top
portion of the screen shows you additional information for each partition on each drive,
such as the file system used, status, free space, and so on. If you right-click a partition in
either area, you can perform a variety of functions, such as formatting the partition and
changing the name and drive letter assignment. For additional options and information, you
can also access the properties of a partition by right-clicking it and selecting Properties.

The basic unit of storage is the disk. Disks are partitioned (primary, logical, extended)
and then formatted for use. With the Windows operating systems this exam focuses on,
you can choose to use either FAT32 or NTFS; the advantage of the latter is that it offers
security and many other features that FAT32 can't handle. Both Windows 7 and Windows
Vista can be installed only in NTFS, but they will recognize FAT partitions.

    If you're using FAT32 and want to change to NTFS, the convert utility will
allow you to do so. For example, to change the E: drive to NTFS, the command
is convert e: /FS:NTFS .

Once the disk is formatted, the next building block is the directory structure, in which you
divide the partition into logical locations for storing data. Whether these storage units are called
directories or folders is a matter of semanticsâ€”they tend to be called folders when viewed in
the graphical user interface (GUI) and directories when viewed from the command line.

## Drive status

The status of a drive can have a number of variables associated with it (System, Boot, and
so on), but what really matters is whether it falls into the category of healthy or unhealthy .
As the title implies, if it is healthy, it is properly working, and if it is unhealthy, you need to
attend to it and correct problems. 
In Figure  you can see in the Status column of Disk Management that all drives are healthy.

## Mounting

Drives must be mounted before they can be used. Within Windows, most removable media
(fl ash drives, CDs, and so forth) are recognized when attached and mounted.
 Volumes on
basic disks, however, are not automatically mounted and assigned drive letters by default.

To mount them, you must manually assign them drive letters or create mount points in
Disk Management.

![note](/img/note.jpg)
You can also mount from the command line using either the Diskpart or
Mountvol utility.

# Initializing

Initializing a disk makes it available to the disk management system, and in most cases the
drive will not show up until you do this. Once the drive has been connected or installed, it
should be initialized. 

Initializing the drive can be done at the command line using diskpart
or in the Disk Management tool.

 You need to know that initialization will wipe out any
drive contents! To use diskpart to perform the initialization on 2 TB drives and smaller,
follow these steps:

```dos
1. Open the Start menu and enter diskpart 
2. Enter list disk 
3. Enter select disk X (where X is the number your drive shows up as).
4. Enter clean 
5. Enter create partition primary 
6. Enter format quick fs=ntfs 
7. Enter assign 
8. Enter exit 
```

To use diskpart to perform the initialization on drives that are 2.5 TB or larger, follow
these steps:

```dos
1. Open the Start menu and enter diskpart 
2. Enter list disk 
3. Enter select disk X (where X is the number your drive shows up as)
4. Enter clean 
5. Enter convert gpt 
6. Enter create partition primary 
7. Enter format quick fs=ntfs 
8. Enter assign
9. Enter exit
```

To use Disk Management, follow this procedure:


```dos
1. Install the drive and reboot the device.
2. In the search line, enter Disk Management. With the drive connected, you will get the pop-up box shown in Figure.
3. If you got the pop-up, choose either MBR or GPT and click OK.
```

The Initialize Disk pop-up

If you didn't get the pop-up, right-click and select to initialize the newly added drive
under where it says Disk 1, as shown in Figure

## Extending partitions

It is possible to add more space to partitions (and logical drives) by extending them into
unallocated space. This is done in Disk Management by right-clicking and choosing Extend
or using the Diskpart utility.

## Splitting partitions

Just as you can extend a partition, you can also reduce the size of it. While this operation
is generically known as splitting the partition, the menu option in Disk Management is
Shrink. By shrinking an existing partition, you are creating another with unallocated space
that can then be used for other purposes. You can shrink only basic volumes that use the
NTFS file system (and space exists) or that do not have a file system.

## Shrinking partitions
It is also possible to shrink a volume from its size at creation. To do so in Disk
Management, access the volume in question, right-click the volume, and select Shrink
Volume, as shown in Figure

**The Shrink Volume option**

![DM](/img/f1.5_dm_shrink.jpg)

This will open another box that will allow you to control how much you want to shrink
the volume, as shown in next Figure

**Setting the volume size**

## Assigning/changing drive letters

Mounting drives and assigning drive letters are two tasks that go hand-in-hand.

When you  mount a drive, you typically assign it a drive letter to be able to access it. 

Right-clicking a volume
in Disk Management gives the option Change Drive Letter And Paths, as shown in Figure

**Changing the drive letter**

## Adding drives
When removable drives are added, the Windows operating system is configured, by default,
to identify them and assign a drive letter. When nonremovable drives are added, you must
mount them and assign a drive letter, as mentioned earlier.

## Adding arrays
Arrays are added to increase fault tolerance (using RAID) or performance (striping). Disk
Management allows you to create and modify arrays as needed.

# Storage spaces

Configuring storage spaces is a fault tolerance and capacity expansion technique that can be
used as an alternative to the techniques described earlier when discussing dynamic volume
types. 
It enables you to virtualize storage by grouping industry-standard disks into storage
pools and then creating virtual disks called storage spaces from the available capacity in the
storage pools. 
This means that, at a high level, you have to do three tasks to use storage spaces.

1. Create a storage pool, which is a collection of physical disks.
2. From the storage pool, create a storage space, which can also be thought of as a virtual disk.
3. Create one or more volumes on the storage space.


First let's look at creating the pool from several physical disks. Each of the disks must be
at least 4 GB in size and should not have any volumes in it. The number of disks required
depends on the type of resiliency you want to provide to the resulting storage space.

Resiliency refers to the type of fault tolerance desired. Use the following guidelines:

- For simple resiliency (no fault tolerance), only a single disk is required for the pool.
- For mirror resiliency, two drives are required.
- For parity resiliency (RAID 5), three drives are required.

To create the pool, access the Control Panel using any of the methods discussed so far
and click the applet Storage Spaces. 

On the resulting page, select the option Create A New
Pool And Storage Space.

 On the Select Drives To Create Storage Pools page, the drives that
are available and supported for storage pools will appear, as shown in Figure

![DM](/img/f1.5_dm_storage_pool1.jpg)

In this case, only one drive is eligible, so you can create only a simple type pool. Check
the drive and click the Create Pool button at the bottom of the page. On the next page,
give the space a name, select a drive letter, and choose the file system (NTFS or REFS), the
resiliency type (in this case you can select only Simple), and the size of the pool. 

Figure
shows the pool as Myspace, with a drive letter of F, an NTFS file system, simple resiliency,
and a maximum size of 100 GB. When you click Create Storage Space, the space will be
created. Be aware that any data on the physical drive will be erased in this process!

![DM](/img/f1.5_dm_storage_pool2.jpg)

When the process is finished, the new space will appear on the Manage Storage Spaces
page. Now you have a pool and a space derived from the pool. 

The last step is to create a
volume in the storage space. If you now access Disk Management, you will see a new virtual
disk called Myspace. It will be a basic disk, but you can convert it to dynamic by rightclicking
it and selecting Convert To Dynamic Disk. This will allow to you shrink or delete
the existing volume if you desire.

A scenario for using diskpart is to extend a partition that is getting full: 

```dos
1. In the command prompt, enter diskpart.
2. At the Diskpart prompt, enter list disk.
3. Then enter select disk n where n is the partition you want to extend.
4. Enter list partition.
5. Select the partition which you want to extend. Enter partition n, where n is the partition you want to extend.
6. Enter extend size=n, where n is the size in megabytes you want to add to the partition.
```
