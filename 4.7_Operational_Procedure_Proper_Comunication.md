# Use proper communication techniques and professionalism.
### Index 

It's possible that you chose computers as your vocation instead of public speaking because
you want to interact with people on a one-on-one basis. As unlikely as that possibility may
be, it still exists.

Some have marveled at the fact that CompTIA includes questions about customer service
on the A+ exam. A better wonder, however, is that there are those in the business who
need to know these items and don't. Possessing a great deal of technology skill does not
immediately endow one with great people skills. A bit more on appropriate behavior as it
relates to the IT field follows. 

**The following are the subobjectives covered in this section:**

- Use proper language and avoid jargon, acronyms, and slang when applicable
- Maintain a positive attitude/project confidence
- Actively listen (taking notes) and avoid interrupting the customer
- Be culturally sensitive
- Be on time (if late, contact the customer)
- Avoid distractions
- Dealing with difficult customers or situations
- Set and meet expectations/timelines and communicate status with the customer
- Deal appropriately with customers' confidential and private materials

# Use proper language and avoid jargon, acronyms, and slang, when applicable

Avoid using jargon, abbreviations, slang, and acronyms. Every field has its own language
that can make those from outside the field feel lost. Put yourself in the position of someone
not in the field, and explain what is going on using words they can relate to.

Be honest and fair with the customer, whoever that is, and try to establish a personal
rapport. Tell them what the problem is, what you believe is the cause, and what can be
done in the future to prevent it from recurring.

Alert your supervisor if there is a communication barrier with the customer (for example,
the customer is deaf or does not speak the same language as you do). This is particularly
important if the barrier will affect the problem resolution or the amount of time it will
take.

**If you're providing phone support, do the following:**
- Always answer the telephone in a professional manner, announcing the name of the company and yourself.
- Make a concentrated effort to ascertain the customer's technical level, and communicate at that level, not above or below it.

# Maintain a positive attitude/project confidence
Maintain a positive attitude. Your approach to the problem, and the customer, can be mirrored
back. Moreover, project confidence in dealing with the issue because that engenders
more cooperation and patience from the customer, both of which have a direct impact on
the success of your troubleshooting efforts.

# Actively listen (taking notes) and avoid interrupting the customer
Good communication includes listening to what the user, manager, or developer is telling
you and making certain that you understand completely what they are trying to say. Just
because a user or customer doesn't understand the terminology, syntax, or concepts that you
do doesn't mean they don't have a real problem that needs addressing. You must, therefore,
be skilled not only at listening but also at translating. 

Professional conduct encompasses
politeness, guidance, punctuality, and accountability. Always treat the customer with the
same respect and empathy you would expect if the situation were reversed. Likewise, guide
the customer through the problem and the explanation. Tell them what has caused the problem
they're currently experiencing and offer the best solution to prevent it from recurring.

# Listen intently to what your customer is saying. Make it obvious to them that you're
listening and respecting what they're telling you. If you have a problem understanding
them, go to whatever lengths you need to in order to remedy the situation. Look for verbal
and nonverbal cues that can help you isolate the problem. Avoid interrupting the customer
because that telegraphs that what he has to say is not important enough to listen to.

# Be culturally sensitive
It is important as well to be culturally sensitive—not everyone enjoys the same humor.
Moreover, be mindful of the difference in the way business is conducted in different cultures
and be flexible in your approach based on this. When you sense that the customer prefers
a more formal relationship with you, try to reflect that in your approach.

# Use appropriate professional titles, when applicable
While many folks are not put off at all when you address them by their first name, in many
cultures it is considered rude to do so, and you should also address the customer using the
appropriate title when applicable. Not all cultures are as informal as what you may have
become accustomed to. Again, sensitivity to the customer's approach to you can be a valuable
clue to how the customer would prefer to interact with you.

# Be on time (if late, contact the customer)
Punctuality is important and should be part of your planning process before you ever
arrive at the site. If you tell the customer you'll be there at 10:30, you need to make every
attempt to be there at that time. If you arrive late, you have given them false hope that
the problem would be solved by a set time. 

That false hope can lead to anger when you
arrive late and appear to not be taking their problem as seriously as they are. Punctuality
continues to be important throughout the service call and doesn't end with your arrival. If
you need to leave to get parts, tell the customer when you'll be back, and then be there at
that time. If for some reason you can't return at the expected time, alert the customer and
inform them of your new return time.

In conjunction with time and punctuality, if a user asks how much longer the server will
be down and you respond that it will up in five minutes only to have it remain down for five
more hours, you're creating resentment and possibly anger. When estimating downtime,
always allow for more time than you think you'll need, just in case other problems occur. If
you greatly underestimate the time, always inform the affected parties and give them a new
time estimate. Here's an analogy that will put it in perspective: If you take your car to get
the oil changed and the counter clerk tells you it will be "about 15 minutes," the last thing
you want is to be sitting there 4 hours later.

# Avoid distractions
It is important that you avoid distractions while working on a customer's or user's problem.
Those distractions can come in the form of personal calls, talking to co-workers, or
personal interruptions.

If you arrive at the site to troubleshoot a problem and there are distractions there of the
customer's making (children present, TV on, and so on), you should politely ask the customer
to remove the distractions if possible. If the area you will be working in is cluttered with personal
items (mementos from the state fair, stuffed animals, and so on), ask the customer to
relocate the items as needed or ask them if it is OK to do so before you relocate the items.

# Personal calls
Taking personal calls while working with a customer can make the customer feel as if
their problem is being minimized. Spend time solving the problem and interacting with the
customer and then attend to the personal calls when you leave.

If you are anticipating an important call that cannot be avoided, let the customer know
beforehand so they will understand that this interruption is coming.

# Texting/social media sites
Keep in mind that when you are supporting a customer, you are working on their time and
not your own. You are also using their equipment, not your own. Consequently, avoid any
use of the customer's equipment or time for personal texts or visits to social media sites.
It is allowable to use the time and the equipment for legitimate research or other activities
that are directly related to solving the customer's issues.

# Talking to co-workers while interacting with customers
Just as taking personal calls can seem to minimize the importance of interacting with the customer,
so too can talking to co-workers. The customer needs to be the focus of your attention
until their problems have been addressed, and then you can attend to other matters.

If you must contact someone else while troubleshooting, always ask the customer's permission.

# Personal interruptions
The broad category of personal interruptions includes anything that takes you away from
focusing on the customer and is not job-related. Spend your time dealing with the customer
first and solving their problems before attending to personal issues.

# Dealing with difficult customers or situations
Handle complaints as professionally as possible. Accept responsibility for errors that may
have occurred on your part, and never try to pass the blame. Remember, the goal is to keep
them as a customer, not to win an argument.

# Do not argue with customers and/or be defensive
Avoid arguing with a customer, because doing so serves no purpose; resolve their anger
with as little conflict as possible. Moreover, don't be defensive when the customer questions
your approach and thought process. While they may clueless about troubleshooting, they
deserve to understand why you are doing what you are doing.

# Avoid dismissing customer's problems
Just as personal calls and interruptions can make it seem as if you are not taking the customer
seriously enough, so too can dismissing their problems as less important than they
believe they are. It is important to put yourself in their shoes and see the issue from their
perspective. What may seem trivial to you may be a vital issue for them.

# Avoid being judgmental
It is important not to minimize their problem or appear to be judgmental.

# Clarify customer statements (ask open-ended questions to narrow the scope of the problem, restate the issue, or question to verify understanding)

The most important skill you can have is the ability to listen. You have to rely on the
customer to tell you the problem and describe it accurately. They can't do that if you're
second-guessing them or jumping to conclusions before the whole story is told. Ask
questions that are broad and open-ended at first and then narrow them down to help
isolate the problem. This is particularly necessary when you are trying to solve the problem
remotely. For example, start with questions like these:

- What were you doing before the problem occurred?
- What application were you using when the problem occurred?

It's also your job to help guide the user's description of the problem. Here are some examples:

- Is the printer plugged in?
- Is it online?
- Are any lights flashing on it?

Restate the issue to the customer to make sure that you correctly understand what they
are telling you (for example, "There is only one green light lit, correct?"). Ask questions as
needed that verify your understanding of the problem. The questions you ask should help
guide you toward isolating the problem and identifying possible solutions.

# Do not disclose experiences via social media outlets
Although it might make you feel better about a particularly trying experience with a customer
to vent about it on social media, don't do that. Not only is it remotely possible that
the post may somehow find its way to the attention of the customer, it reflects poorly on
you as someone who shares his business dealings with the world.

# Set and meet expectations/timeline and communicate status with the customer

Customer satisfaction goes a long way toward generating repeat business. If you can meet
the customer's expectations, you'll almost assuredly hear from them again when another
problem arises. If you can exceed the customer's expectations, you can almost guarantee
that they will call you the next time a problem arises.

Customer satisfaction is important in all communication media—whether you're on-site,
providing phone support, or communicating through email or other correspondence.
Share the customer's sense of urgency. What may seem like a small problem to you can
appear to the customer as if the whole world is collapsing around them.

# Offer different repair/replacement options if applicable
If there are multiple solutions to the problem the customer is encountering, offer options to
them. Those options often include repairing what they already have or replacing it. If the
repair could lead to a recurrence of the situation but the replacement will not, then that
should be explained to them clearly.

The ramifications of each choice should be clearly explained along with costs (estimates,
if necessary) so they can make the decision they deem in their best interest.

If you are unable to resolve the issue, explain to the customer what to do and make sure
to follow up properly to forward the issue to appropriate personnel.

# Provide proper documentation on the services provided
Document the services you provided so there is no misunderstanding on the part of the customer.

Supply them with the documentation and keep a copy handy to refer to should any
questions arise. Explain clearly the cause of the problem and how to avoid it in the future.

It is important that the documentation be complete so that if you do not refer to it for
quite some time (years), you will still be able to understand and explain what was done.

# Follow up with customer/user at a later date to verify satisfaction 

When you fi nish a job, notify the user you're done. Make every attempt to fi nd the user
and inform them of the resolution. If it's diffi cult to fi nd them, leave a note for them to fi nd
when they return, explaining the resolution. You should also leave a means by which they
can contact you, should they have a question about the resolution or a related problem. In
most cases, the number you leave should be that of your business during working hours and
your pager, where applicable, after hours.

If you do not hear back from the customer, follow up with them at a later date to verify
that the problem is resolved and they are satisfi ed with the outcome. One of the best ways
to keep customers is to let them know that you care about their success and satisfaction.

# Deal appropriately with customers' confidential and private materials

The goal of confi dentiality is to prevent or minimize unauthorized access to fi les and
folders and disclosure of data and information. In many instances, laws and regulations
require specifi c information confi dentiality. For example, Social Security records, payroll
and employee records, medical records, and corporate information are high-value assets.

This information could create liability issues or embarrassment if it fell into the wrong
hands. Over the last few years, there have been several cases in which bank account and
credit card numbers were published on the Internet. The costs of these types of breaches
of confi dentiality far exceed the actual losses from the misuse of this information.

Confidentiality entails ensuring that data expected to remain private is
seen only by those who should see it. Confidentiality is implemented
through authentication and access controls.

Just as confidentiality issues are addressed early in the design phase of a project, you
as a computer professional are expected to uphold a high level of confi dentiality. Should a
user approach you with a sensitive issue—telling you their password, asking for assistance
obtaining access to medical forms, and so on—it's your obligation as part of your job to
make certain that information passes no further.

# Located on a computer, desktop, printer, etc.
Technicians may come into contact with confidential information in the course of performing
their job duties. That information could come in the form of data stored on a computer,
information on a desktop, data (in any form) on a printer, and many other locations. When
that possibility exists, ask users to remove such confidential information or close the application
that displays it (saving their work before they close).

If the area where you will be working is cluttered with personal information (printed
customer lists, and so on), ask the customer to relocate the items if possible. No confidential
information should ever be disclosed to outside parties.
