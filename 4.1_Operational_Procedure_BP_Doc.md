# Compare and contrast best practices associated with types of documentation.
### Index 

If you ever heard the adage "**the job isn't done till the paperwork is done,**" then you may
grasp the importance of documentation. 

In this section, we'll talk about some of documentation you should be generating and updating. 

**Topics include the following:**

- [Network topology diagrams](#Network_topology_diagrams)
- [Knowledge base/articles ](#Knowledge_base/articles)
- [Incident documentation](#Incident_documentation)
- [Regulatory and compliance policy ](#Regulatory_and_compliance_policy)
- [Acceptable use policy](#Acceptable_use_policy)
- [Password policy](#Password_policy)
- [Inventory management](#Inventory_management)


# Network_topology_diagrams

All network diagrams should be kept in both hard copy and digital format. Moreover, this
document must be closely integrated with the change management process. 

The change
management policy should specifically call for the updating of this document at the conclusion
of any change made to the network that impacts the network diagram and should
emphasize that no change procedure is considered to be complete unless this update has
occurred.

There are two types of network topologies, physical and logical. 

The physical diagram
focuses on the cabling, connections, and locations of devices.

The logical diagram illustrates
data flows that may or may not follow the physical diagram.

# Knowledge_base/articles

Often in the process of troubleshooting an issue, you may find useful information in a
knowledge base article. Vendors share these documents to assist technicians.

You should
keep these articles and tie them to the issue they solved. This will help solve future
instances of the same issue.

# Incident_documentation

Just as you should keep all technical articles that help to solve an issue, all incidents should
be recorded in detail for future reference. 

This helps to identify recurring issues for which
the root cause has yet to be determined. With regard to security incidents, your incident
handling policy should support this effort.

# Regulatory_and_compliance_policy

It is your responsibility, as an administrator and a professional, to know (or learn) the regulations
that exist for dealing with safety. 

You should know them from the local level to the
federal level and be familiar with the reporting procedures for incidents you are faced with.
If employees are injured, for example, you may need to contact the **Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA)**. 

On its website (**www.osha.gov**), you can find links to
information about issues of compliance, laws and regulation, and enforcement.
When it comes to disposal of hardware, you can find a list of state laws here:

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) offers basic information here:

# Acceptable_use_policy

The most effective method of preventing viruses, spyware, and harm to data is education.
Teach your users not to open suspicious files and to open only those files that they're
reasonably sure are virus-free. They need to scan every disk, email, and document they
receive before they open it. 

You should also have all workstations scheduled to be automatically
scanned on a regular basis.

While education is important, in most cases you must also attempt to control what users
do. An **acceptable use policy (AUP)** is a document that specifies what users can and cannot
do, and it should be signed by all during the hiring process. 

**This creates a contract that can
be used later to form the basis for disciplinary measures.**

These measures or consequences
for noncompliance should be spelled out ahead of time. The AUP should be reviewed at
least annually, and if changes are made, personnel should have to re-sign the agreement.

# Password_policy

One of the strongest ways to keep a system safe is to employ strong password polices and
educate your users in the best security practices. In this section, you'll explore various techniques
that can enhance the security of your user passwords.

## Setting strong passwords
Passwords should be as long as possible. Most security experts believe a password of 10
characters is the minimum that should be used if security is a real concern. 

If you use only
the lowercase letters of the alphabet, you have 26 characters with which to work. If you
add the numeric values 0 through 9, you'll get another 10 characters. 

If you go one step further
and add the uppercase letters, you'll then have an additional 26 characters, giving you
a total of 62 characters with which to construct a password.

## Password expiration
The longer a password is used, the more likely it is that it will be compromised in some
way. It is for this reason that requiring users to change their passwords at certain intervals
increases the security of their passwords. 

You should require users to set a new password
every 30 days (more frequently for higher security networks), and you must also prevent
them from reusing old passwords. Most password management systems have the ability to
track previously used passwords and to disallow users from recycling old passwords.

## Changing default usernames/passwords
Default accounts represent a huge weakness in that every miscreant knows they exist.

When an operating system is installed, whether on a workstation or a server, there are certain
accounts created, and since the wrongdoer already knows the account name, it simplifies
the process of getting into an account by requiring them to supply only the password.
The first thing they will try, of course, is the default password if one exists.


## Screensaver required password
A screensaver should automatically start after a short period of idle time, and that screensaver
should require a password before the user can begin the session again. This method of
locking the workstation adds one more level of security.

## BIOS/UEFI
Passwords should be configured and required to access either the BIOS or UEFI settings on
all devices. If this is not the case, it would be possible for someone to reboot a device, enter
the settings, change the boot order, boot to an operating system residing on a USB or optical
drive, and use that OS as a platform to access data located on the other drives. 

While
this is a worst-case scenario, there is also much less mayhem a malicious person could cause
in the BIOS and UEFI.


## Requiring passwords
Make absolutely certain you require passwords (a simple thing to overlook in a small network)
for all accounts, and change the default passwords on system accounts.

# Inventory_management
**Inventory management includes knowing what you have.**

You can't know that something
is missing until you take an inventory, so this should be done on a regular basis. What type
of information is useful to record in these inventories? 

You may choose to record more, but
three items should be included for sure.

## Make
The manufacturer of the device should be recorded and the name they give the device
should as well.

## Model
The exact model number should be recorded in full, leaving nothing out. 

Sometimes those
dangling letters at the end of the model number are there to indicate how this model differs
from another or could indicate a feature, so record all of it.

## Serial number
The serial number of the device should be recorded. This is a number that will be important
to you with respect to the warranty and service support. 

You should be able to put
your hands on this number quickly.

## Asset tags
If your organization places asset tags on the devices, it probably means you have your own
internal numbering or other identification system in place. 

Record that number and any
other pertinent information that the organization deems important enough to place on the
asset tag such as region, building, and so on.

## Barcodes
One popular methods of tagging devices is with barcodes that can be read by scanners
when performing an inventory. If these are RFID tags, they can even be read from a short
distance.
