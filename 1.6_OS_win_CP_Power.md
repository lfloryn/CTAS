# Power Options

Here you can configure different power schemes to adjust power consumption, dictating
when devices—the display and the computer—will turn off or be put to sleep. 

Through the
Advanced Settings, you can configure the need to enter a password to revive the devices, as
well as configure wireless adapter settings, Internet options (namely, JavaScript), and the
system sleep policy. Common choices include the following:

- Standby puts your computer into energy-saving mode, where it uses little power.
- Hibernate saves your workspace (all your open windows) and then turns the computer off.
- Sleep/suspend puts your computer into an even deeper energy-saving mode than

Standby, where it uses even less power.

## Power plans
Power plans are collections of power settings that determine when various components in
the device are shut down. There are some built-in plans available, or you can create your
own. There are three default plans: 

Balanced, which strikes a balance between performance
and saving power; 

Power Saver, which errs on the side of saving power at the expense of
performance; and High Performance, which errs on the side of performance over power
saving. 

These options appear on the opening page when you open Power Options, as
shown in Figure . To create a power, select Create A Power Plan from the tree menu
on the left.
