# Proxy settings

Proxy settings identify the proxy server to be used to gain Internet access. The proxy server
is responsible for making the Internet access possible and may utilize Network Address
Translation (NAT) to translate between the public network (Internet) and the private network
(on which the host sits). 

These settings are configured by using the LAN Settings button
in the Connections tab to open the dialog box shown in Figure.
