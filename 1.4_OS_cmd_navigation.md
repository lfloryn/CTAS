# Navigation
Some commands are used to navigate the file system. The three commands in this section
are used for that purpose.

```dos
dir
```

The DIR command is simply used to view a listing of the files and folders that exist within a
directory, subdirectory, or folder. The following is the syntax:

```dos
dir [Drive:][Path][FileName] [...] [/p] [/q] [/w] [/d][/a[[:]attributes]][/o[[:]SortOrder]] [/t[[:]TimeField]] [/s] [/b] [/l] [/n] [/x] [/c] [/4]
```
