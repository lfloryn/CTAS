# Navigation
Some commands are used to navigate the file system. The three commands in this section
are used for that purpose.

```dos
dir
```

The DIR command is simply used to view a listing of the files and folders that exist within a
directory, subdirectory, or folder. The following is the syntax:

```dos
dir [Drive:][Path][FileName] [...] [/p] [/q] [/w] [/d][/a[[:]attributes]][/o[[:]SortOrder]] [/t[[:]TimeField]] [/s] [/b] [/l] [/n] [/x] [/c] [/4]
```
![Dir](/img/f1.4_1_dir_1.jpg)
![Dir](/img/f1.4_1_dir_2.jpg)

# cd and ..
The change directory (cd) command is used to move to another folder or directory.
 It is used in both UNIX and Windows. Parameters are shown below.

![cd](/img/f1.4_2_cd.jpg)

# Help 


```dos
Displays the name of or changes the current directory.

CHDIR [/D] [drive:][path]
CHDIR [..]
CD [/D] [drive:][path]
CD [..]

  ..   Specifies that you want to change to the parent directory.

Type CD drive: to display the current directory in the specified drive.
Type CD without parameters to display the current drive and directory.

Use the /D switch to change current drive in addition to changing current
directory for a drive.

If Command Extensions are enabled CHDIR changes as follows:

The current directory string is converted to use the same case as
the on disk names.  So CD C:\TEMP would actually set the current
directory to C:\Temp if that is the case on disk.

CHDIR command does not treat spaces as delimiters, so it is possible to
CD into a subdirectory name that contains a space without surrounding
the name with quotes.  For example:

    cd \winnt\profiles\username\programs\start menu

is the same as:

    cd "\winnt\profiles\username\programs\start menu"

which is what you would have to type if extensions were disabled.
```
