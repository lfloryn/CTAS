# **Compare and contrast features of Microsoft Windows versions.**

This section contains numerous tables because of the nature of the information that it covers. It is imperative that you be familiar with **Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1**, and **Windows 10**. Make certain you understand the features available in each of these versions of Windows as well as the editions that were made available for each of them. The topics covered in this section of the chapter are as follows:
- Windows 7
- Windows 8
- Windows 8.1
- Windows 10
- Corporate vs. personal needs
- Desktop styles/user interface

## Windows 7
Windows 7 was released in 2009, much to the delight of many users who were dissatisfied with Windows Vista. It has had one service pack and is still widely used even though three operating system versions have been released since. It comes in six editions, each of which
differs in requirements and capabilities.
Table shows the available editions and their hardware requirements.

## Windows 8
Windows 8 was released in 2012 and was never fully embraced. Many corporate teams skipped from Windows 7 to Windows 10. Among the chief complaints about Windows 8 were the confusing Start screen and the new Metro desktop. Sometimes it's not good to shake things up too soon.

## Windows 8.1
Released a year after its predecessor, Windows 8.1 expanded functionality available to apps compared to Windows 8, but still was avoided because of the new interface. It did introduce OneDrive integration and added expanded tutorials for the new interface (to no avail).

**The following are hardware requirement for Windows 8.1:**
- Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster with support for physical address extension (PAE), NX, and Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 (SSE2)
- RAM: 1 gigabyte (GB) (32-bit) or 2 GB (64-bit)
- Hard disk space: 16 GB (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit)
- Graphics card: Microsoft DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM driver

## Windows 10
It seems that Microsoft has fallen into a pattern of succeeding with every other version number as Windows 10 has been a success. In May 2018 it did undergo an update that seems to cause no major issues. Windows 10 supports universal apps, which are those designed to
run across multiple platforms. Its interface is friendly to both the mouse and touchscreen navigation. The movement away from the tablet look in Windows 8 has been well received.

**The following are hardware requirements for Windows 10:**
- Processor: 1 GHz or faster processor or SoC
- RAM: 1 (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit
- Hard disk space: 16 GB for 32-bit OS 20 GB for 64-bit OS
- Graphics card: DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver
- Display: 800×600

## Corporate vs. personal needs
### There are features present in Windows that cater to personal needs, while others are more relevant to the corporate environment. In this section we'll look at a few of these features.

## Domain access
Not all editions of Windows can join a domain. Home editions cannot, while Professional and Enterprise editions can. To join a **Windows 7/8/10** computer to a domain, do the following:

    1. Navigate to Start ➢ Control Panel ➢ System And Security ➢ System ➢ Advanced System Settings. In the Control Panel's Category view, you can simply select System.

    2. Click the Computer Name tab and click the Change button.

    3. Select the Domain radio button and enter the name of the domain.

    4. Click OK, and the join process will start.

    
## Bitlocker
BitLocker allows you to use drive encryption to protect files—including those needed for startup and logon. This is available with the Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows 7 and the Pro and Enterprise editions of Windows 8, 8.1, and 10. For removable drives,
BitLocker To Go provides the same encryption technology to help prevent unauthorized access to the files stored on them.

## Media center
Media Center is one of the features that will probably be used more at home. It is a digital video recorder and media player created by Microsoft. Media Center was first introduced to Windows in 2002. It was discontinued after Windows 7 and available as a paid add-on
in Windows 8 and 8.1. It is not available in Windows 10.

## Branchcache
BranchCache is a bandwidth-optimization feature that started with Windows 7. Each client has a cache and acts as an alternate source for content requested by devices on its own network.
There are two modes, Hosted Cache and Distributed. In Hosted Cache mode, designated servers act as a cache for files requested by clients in its area. In Distributed mode, each client contains a cached version of the BranchCache-enabled files it has requested and  received, and it acts as a distributed cache for other clients requesting that same file.

## EFS
The Encrypting File System (EFS) is an encryption tool built into Windows 7, and Windows 8 or 8.1 Professional or Enterprise. (EFS is not fully supported on Windows 7 Starter, Windows 7 Home Basic, and Windows 7 Home Premium or Windows 10 editions.) It allows a user to encrypt files that can be decrypted only by the user who encrypted the files. 

It can be used only on NTFS volumes but is simple to use. 

    To encrypt a file in Windows 8.1, simply right-click the file, access the file's properties, and on the General tab click the Advanced button. 
    That will open the Advanced Attributes dialog box, as shown in Figure . On this page, select the Encrypt Contents To Secure Data box.

## Desktop styles/user interface
Desktop styles or interfaces have changed slightly from Windows 7 to Windows 10. The following are some of the features of the interfaces.

## Aero
The Aero interface offers a glass design that includes translucent windows. It was new with Windows Vista. It requires a graphics card with DirectX 9 graphics with 128 MB RAM to functions and can be enabled in Control Panel.

## Gadgets
These are mini programs, introduced with Windows Vista, that can be placed on the desktop (Windows 7), allowing them to run quickly and letting you personalize the PC (clock, weather, and so on). Windows 7 renamed these Windows Desktop Gadgets (right-click the desktop and click Gadgets in the context menu; then double-click the one you want to add).

In 2011, Microsoft announced it is no longer supporting the development or uploading of new gadgets. 

**No operating system after Windows 7 supports Gadgets.**

### XP Mode as a VM ?
You can also install an XP mode virtual machine using these instructions:

## Side-by-side apps
Windows 8.1 and 10 allow you to run a Metro application (also called at various times Tileworld apps and modern apps; these are apps you get at the Windows Store) and a desktop application at the same time, or up to four Metro apps at the same time, which on
other devices such as a smartphone may not be possible.

To do this, you must split the screen into two parts, which can be done in two ways.

- If you have a keyboard, you can press Windows +< or Windows +> . The current app's window is now shoved to the left or right side. When you open a second app (from the Start screen or the app switcher), it fills the newly opened space.
- You can also drag the left edge of an open app and divide the screen.

## Metro UI
In Windows 8.1, the user interface is different from earlier versions of Windows. The Start menu was removed, and the desktop replaced with a new look called Metro. This look resembles the interface of a smartphone or tablet and represents the Microsoft vision of a
common interface on all devices. Information, settings, and applications are housed in tiles.
Figure shows this look.

![metro](/img/metro.jpg)

This look received negative reactions from most desktop and laptop users and more positive
reactions from those raised on the smartphone interface. Microsoft reacted by changing
the name of the look to the Microsoft design language. While there were rumors of
a return to the Start menu, Microsoft made the classic Start menu available in Windows
8.1 but by default stuck to its guns and continued to use a Start screen rather than a Start
menu. (The Start screen is covered in the "Start screen" section.)

## Pinning
Pinning is the process of configuring an icon for a program on the taskbar so that it is
easier to locate. It was introduced in Windows 7 and continued in Windows 8, 8.1, and 10,
and for frequently used applications, it saves navigating through the Start menu or Start
screen to locate the application.
To pin the program to the taskbar in Windows 7, do one of the following:
- If the program is running, right-click the program's button on the taskbar (or drag the
button toward the desktop) to open the program's Jump List and then click Pin This
Program To Taskbar.
- If the program is not running, click Start, find the program's icon, right-click the icon,
and then click Pin To Taskbar.

**To pin the program to the taskbar in Windows 8, 8.1, and 10, follow these steps:**

1. Point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click
Search. On a touchscreen device, swipe in from the right edge of the screen and then
tap Search.
2. Enter the name of the program in the search box.
3. In the search results, right-click Internet Explorer and then click Pin To Taskbar.
Prior to Windows 8, if you set up multiple monitors, you could have the taskbar only
on the primary monitor, which meant you had to go back to that monitor (which may not
be where you are currently engaged) to access the taskbar. In Windows 8 and 8.1, you can
now have your taskbar on all monitors by selecting the option in the properties of the taskbar,
as shown in Figure .

## Charms
Charms are a bit like icons and were introduced with Windows 8 and the Metro UI.
They are organized on a Charms bar that will appear on the right side of the screen when
invoked. With the mouse you bring up the bar by moving the cursor into the right corner of
the desktop; on a touchscreen, you swipe from the right edge toward the center.

There are five charms there that are like doors to other lists of options. The five charms
are Search, Share, Start, Devices, and Settings. 

The Start charm simply opens the Start
screen, which replaces the Start menu. Figure shows the Charms bar.

## Start screen
One of the more controversial changes to the user interface with Windows 8 and 8.1 was
removing the Start menu and replacing it with the Start screen. Shown in metro Figure  earlier,
this is the screen that appears to be the future of all Windows operating systems, despite
the resistance of many desktop and laptop users.
