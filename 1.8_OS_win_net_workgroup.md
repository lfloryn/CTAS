# HomeGroup vs. Workgroup

As you learned in the previous objective, HomeGroup offers a simplified way to set up a
home network. It allows you to share files (including libraries) and prevent changes from
being made to those files by those sharing them (unless you give them permission to do so).

All computers participating in the HomeGroup must be running Windows 7, 8, 8.1, or
10, and the network can never grow beyond a limited size. While all editions of Windows
7 can join a HomeGroup, not all can create a HomeGroup. Windows 8 and Windows 8.1
clients can do both.

An alternative to make sharing easier in the home is to add all the computers to a peerto-
peer network. A peer-to-peer network, one of two network types you can create in
Windows (also known as a workgroup), consists of a number of workstations (two or more)
that share resources among themselves. 

The resources shared are traditionally file and print
access, and every computer has the capacity to act as a workstation (by accessing resources
from another machine) and as a server (by offering resources to other machines).


The other network type is client-server (or a domain). The primary distinction between
workgroups and client-server networks is where security is controlled: locally on each
workstation or centrally on a server. A domain is a centrally managed group of computers,
and physical proximity does not matter; the computers within a domain may all be on the
same LAN or spread across a WAN.

The advantage of a peer-to-peer network is that the cost is lower; you need only add
cards and cables to the computers you already have if you're running an operating system
that allows such modifications. With a server-based network, you must buy a server—a
dedicated machine—and thus the costs are higher. It's never recommended that a peerto-
peer network be used for more than 10 workstations because the administration and
management become so significant that a server-based network makes far greater sense.
