# **Use appropriate Microsoft command-line tools.**

Although the exam is on the Windows operating systems, it tests many concepts that carry
over from the earlier Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS), which was never meant
to be extremely friendly. Its roots are in CP/M, which was based on the command line,
and so is MS-DOS. In other words, these systems use long strings of commands typed in at
the computer keyboard to perform operations. Some people prefer this type of interaction
with the computer, including many folks with technical backgrounds (such as yours truly).

Although Windows has left the full command-line interface behind, it still contains a bit of
DOS, and you get to it through the command prompt.

Although you can't tell from looking at it, the Windows command prompt is actually a
Windows program that is intentionally designed to have the look and feel of a DOS command
line. Because it is, despite its appearance, a Windows program, the command prompt
provides all the stability and configurability you expect from Windows. You can access a
command prompt by running CMD.EXE.

A number of diagnostic utilities are often run at the command prompt. Since knowledge
of each is required for the exam, they are discussed next in the order given.
